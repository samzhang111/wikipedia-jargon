The included data files are
- `simple-wiki-math.xml` --> Simple Wikipedia math category pages
- `wiki-math.xml` --> English Wikipedia math category pages
- `*.p` --> pickled version of cleaned up, dictionary-fied content of the above
- `term_differences.csv` --> output, the actual differences in term frequencies
