    <h1>Term differences in technical articles on Simple vs. English Wikipedia</h1>
<div>
    What can we learn about the language used in technical fields
    by looking at the differences explanations used for different
    level audiences? I've downloaded the content of sixteen

    Wikipedia</a> and compared them to their equivalent pages on <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org">English Wikipedia</a>.
