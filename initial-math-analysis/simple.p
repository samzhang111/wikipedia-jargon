S'Heuristic'
p2
(lp3
VA heuristic is a practical way to solve a problem. It is better than chance, but does not always work. A person develops a heuristic by using intelligence, experience, and common sense. Trial and error is the simplest heuristic, but one of the weakest. Rule of thumb and 'educated guesses' are other names for simple heuristics. Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result, there are always exceptions.
p4
aVSometimes heuristics are rather vague: 'look before you leap' is a guide to behaviour, but 'think about the consequences' is a bit clearer. Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages. When doctors examines a patient, they go through a whole set of tests and observations. They may not find out what is wrong, but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding. This is called a diagnosis.
p5
aVIn computer science, a 'heuristic' is a kind of algorithm. Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem. A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions, but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct. The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration.
p6
aVBackground.
p7
aVHeuristics is the art of finding an adequate solution to a problem, using limited knowledge and little time. More formally, heuristics are based on experience; they can speed up the search for a solution using simple rules. A complete search may take too long, or may be too difficult to do. 
p8
aVIn more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings and machines.
p9
aVHeuristics can be used in some fields of science, but not in others: For economics, a solution that is one percent off is often acceptable; a telescope that has an error of one degree is probably unusable if aimed at a far-away object. The same telescope pointed to the window across the street will probably tolerate this error; missing by one degree will not have a big impact on a short distance. 
p10
aVHeuristics can be used to estimate an answer which is then made more clear by performing an exact solution at a very small scale, perhaps to save time, money or labor on a project - for example a heuristic guess as to how much weight a bridge is expected to carry can be used to determine whether the bridge should be made of wood, stone or steel, and appropriate quantities of the needed material can be purchased while the exact design of the bridge is being completed.
p11
aVHowever, the use of heuristics in certain very technical fields may be damaging computer science is one example. Programming a computer to perform more or less the desired actions may result in severe glitches. Therefore computer tasks generally must be fairly exact. However, there are certain areas in which computers can calculate heuristic solutions safely for example Google's search technology relies heavily on heuristics, producing "near-miss" matches to a search query when an exact match cannot be found. This enables a user to correct for any mistakes the search produces. Example: Searching for the name "Peter Smith" and unable to find that exact name, the search engine heuristically matches "Pete Smith" instead, and the person using the search engine must decide whether Pete and Peter are the same person.
p12
aVExamples.
p13
aVPolya.
p14
aVHere are some other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, "How to Solve It":
p15
aVPacking problem.
p16
aVOne example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem. The problem consists of packing a number of items. There are rules that need to be respected. For example, each item has a value and a weight. The problem now is to get the most valuable items, with the least weight possible. Another instance is fitting a number of differently-sized items into a confined space, like the trunk of a car.
p17
aVTo get the perfect solution to the problem, all possibilities must be tried. This is often not a good option, as trying them takes a long time, and on average, half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found. So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item, fit it in, and then try to arrange the other items around it. This will give a good solution, most of the time. There are cases however, where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used. 
p18
aVTherefore, this is a heuristic solution.

asS'History of mathematics'
p20
(lp21
VHistory of mathematics is how mathematics has developed over time. Early maths by Babylonians and Egyptians was built upon by Greeks such as Euclid, Archimedes, Pythagoras and Eratosthenes. Other important figures include Fibonacci, Descartes, Leonhard Euler, Blaise Pascal and Gauss.
p22
asS'Ratio'
p23
(lp24
VA ratio between two or more quantities is a way of measuring their sizes compared to each other. 
p25
aVFor example, if a school has 20 teachers and 500 pupils then the ratio of teachers to students is written as 20:500 (read as "20 to 500"). For another example, if a cake mix asks for 100 grams of flour, 300 grams of butter and 25 grams of sugar then the ratio of flour to butter to sugar is written as 100:300:25 (read as "100 to 300 to 25"). 
p26
aVRatios can be simplified. In the school example, there were 20 teachers to 500 pupils. If we divided the children up into equally sized classes then each teacher's class would have 25 pupils. That means that for each teacher there are 25 pupils, i.e. the teacher to pupil ratio is 1:25. Another way to go from the ratio 20:500 to the ratio 1:25 is to simply divide both numbers in 20:500 by 20. Note: The ratio 20:500 is the same as 1:25. They are just two ways of writing the same thing. Just like there are different ways of writing a fraction (for example ), there are many ways of writing a ratio. 
p27
asS'Probability space'
p28
(lp29
VProbability space is a mathematical model used to describe scientific experiments A probablity space consists of three parts:
p30
aVAn "outcome" is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex "events" are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a "\u03c3-algebra" formula_1. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the "probability measure" function, "P".
p31
aVOnce the probability space is established, it is assumed that \u201cnature\u201d makes its move and selects a single outcome, "\u03c9", from the sample space \u03a9. All the events in formula_1 that contain the selected outcome "\u03c9" (recall that each event is a subset of \u03a9) are said to \u201chave occurred\u201d. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function "P".
p32
aVThe prominent Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov introduced the notion of probability space, together with other axioms of probability, in the 1930s.
p33
asS'Planck time'
p34
(lp35
VThe Planck time is the length of time at which no smaller meaningful length can be validly measured due to the indeterminacy expressed in Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Theoretically, this is the shortest time measurement that is possible. Planck time is roughly 10\u221244 seconds. However, as of May 2010, the smallest time interval that was directly measured was 10\u221217 seconds.
p36
aVOne Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one Planck length.
p37
aVIt is figured out from the Planck constant, which was first thought of by the physicist Max Planck in 1900. This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the joule by using the proportionality constant Planck gave us. Heisenberg's original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague Max Born. Born put Heisenberg's equation into a matrix form. Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix. In matrix multiplication multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P. He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves h, the Planck proportionality constant. It shows that one can never pin down things like P (momentum) and X (location) exactly. It turns out that we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum. We get closer and closer and then we reach the "Planck time."
p38
asS'Piecewise'
p39
(lp40
VIn mathematics, a piecewise function is a function that can give different outputs based on its input. For example, there might be a function which gives when x > 0, and when x \u2264 0.
p41
asS'Number line'
p42
(lp43
VA number line is a line with integers (simply ordinary numbers, ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...) on it extending forever in both directions. Usually, zero (0) is placed in the middle of the line. The numbers have an equal space from each other. Other numbers in between the numbers on the line represent rational, irrational, and other types of real numbers.
p44
aVThere is another number line, equally valid and useful, that extends vertically through 0 (the origin) at right angles to our traditional number line and uses imaginary numbers ("i"). These so called imaginary numbers extend above and below the traditional number line and are used in very real calculations in many areas of science and technology and also extend in both directions forever (into infinity).
p45
aVDifferent forms.
p46
aVA number line is usually drawn as a simple horizontal line. Another form is the helical number line. If the line of numbers is wrapped around a cylinder following an upward helical path, it becomes a helical number line.
p47
aVIf the circumference of the cylinder is equal to the length occupied by ten numbers on the number line, it then becomes a decimal helical number line, and the numbers arrange themselves into columns, each number in a particular column having the same number ending.
p48
asS'Associativity'
p49
(lp50
VAssociativity is a property of mathematical operations (like addition and multiplication). It means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator (like +) in a row, the order of operations does not matter.
p51
aVFor example, if you have formula_1, there are two plus signs (+) in a row. This means we can add it in either this order:
p52
aV formula_2
p53
aVOr this order:
p54
aV formula_3
p55
aVThe answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative.
p56
aVIn other words, associativity means:
p57
aV formula_4
p58
aVNot all operations are associative. Subtraction is not associative, which means:
p59
aV formula_5
p60
aVThis is true because:

aVAnd:

aV formula_8
p65
aVAlso, associativity is different from commutativity, which lets you move the numbers around.
p66
asS'Discrete mathematics'
p67
(lp68
VDiscrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that vary "smoothly", discrete mathematics studies objects such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic. These objects do not vary smoothly, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus and analysis. Discrete objects can often be counted using integers. Mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of the term "discrete mathematics." Many times, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.
p69
aVThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.
p70
aVResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. In turn, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.
p71
aVAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.
p72
asS'Weighted average'
p73
(lp74
VA weighted average is the average of values which are scaled by importance. The weighted average of values is the sum of weights times values divided by the sum of the weights.
p75
aVBasic example.
p76
aVGiven two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students, the grades in each class on a test were:
p77
aVMorning class = 62, 67, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 89, 93, 98
p78
aVAfternoon class = 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 90, 90, 90, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99
p79
aVThe straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. The straight average of 80 and 90 is 85, the mean of the two class means. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class, hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):
p80
aVformula_1
p81
aVOr, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class (using a weighted mean of the class means):
p82
aVformula_2
p83
aVThus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available.
p84
asS'Modulo operation'
p85
(lp86
VIn mathematics the result of the modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division. As is well known, an arithmetic division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder.
p87
aVHowever, other conventions are possible. Computers and calculators have various ways of storing and representing numbers. Their definition of the modulo operation depends on the programming language and/or the underlying hardware.
p88
asS'Function space'
p89
(lp90
VIn mathematics, a function space is a set of functions of a given kind from a set X to a set Y. For example:
p91
asS'Formal language'
p92
(lp93
VIn mathematics, logic, and computer science, a formal language is a language that is defined in a precise mathematical way. A language is defined using a set called the alphabet of the language. The members of the alphabet are usually called "symbols" of the language. The language is a set of sequences of symbols of the alphabet. The sequences usually have finite length. The sequences that are members of the language are called the "words" of the language or "strings".
p94
aVA precise definition is that 
p95
aVa formal language formula_1 is typically characterized as an ordered pair of sets formula_2. formula_3 is the alphabet, and each element of formula_4 is a sequence of elements. 
p96
aVFormal languages have lots of uses. A formal language is often thought of as: 
p97
aVor 
p98
aVIn the first case, the set formula_3 is called the "alphabet" of formula_1, and the elements of formula_7 are called "words". In the second, the set formula_3 is called the "lexicon" or the "vocabulary" of formula_7, while the elements of formula_7 are then called "sentences". The mathematical theory that treats formal languages in general is known as "formal language theory".
p99
aVAlthough it is common to hear the term "formal language" meaning natural language that is more stilted, disciplined or precise than everyday speech, this article refers to the meaning in formal language theory, in maths, logic or computer science. 
p100
aVAs an example of formal language, an alphabet might be formula_11. One string over that alphabet is formula_12. 
p101
aVA typical language over that alphabet, containing that string, would be the set of all strings which contain the same number of symbols formula_13 and formula_14.
p102
aVThe empty word (that is, length-zero string) is allowed and is often denoted by formula_15, formula_16 or formula_17. While the alphabet is a finite set and every string has finite length, a language may very well have infinitely many member strings. This is because the length of words belonging to it may be unbounded.
p103
aVA question often asked about formal languages is "how difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a particular language?"
p104
aVThis is the kind of question that computability theory and complexity theory ask.

asS'Theorem'
p110
(lp111
VA theorem is a proven idea in mathematics. Theorems are proved using logic and other theorems that have already been proved. A theorem that someone must prove so that he/she can prove another theorem is called a lemma. Theorems are made of two parts, there are hypotheses and conclusions. 
p112
aVTheorems use deduction, in contrast to theories which are empirical.
p113
aVSome theorems are trivial, they directly follow from the propositions. Other theorems are called "deep", their proof is long and difficult. Sometimes, such proofs involve other areas of matematics or show connections between different areas. A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is Fermat's Last Theorem, and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics, among other areas. 
p114
aVThere are other theorems for which a proof is known, but it cannot easily be written down. Among the best examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search which is then verified by a computer program. At first, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted in recent years. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.

VThe International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is a six-question two-day math competition for students that have not yet went to college and are under 20 years old. Any country may take part in it by sending a team of six students to compete.
p121
aVThe IMO has been held every year since 1959. It takes place in a different country (which is called the "host country") from year to year.
p122
asS'Axiom'
p123
(lp124
VAn axiom is something used in logic. It is a statement which has no proof. This means it can not be proved within the discussion of a problem. So inside some discussion, it is thought to be true. There are many reasons why it has no proof. For example,
p125
aVLogic can be used to find theorems from the axioms. Then those theorems can be used to make more theorems. This is often how math works. Axioms are important because logical arguments start with them.

p130
asS'Least common multiple'
p131
(lp132
VThe least common multiple of two integers is the smallest positive integer between all the multiples of both. It is usually denoted by '"LCM("a", "b")"'. Likewise, the LCM of more than two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.
p133
aVThe LCM is known in elementary arithmetic as the "least common denominator" (LCD) that must be calculated before fractions can be added, subtracted or compared.
p134
aVOverview.
p135
aVA multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of \u22125 and 2 as well.

VIn math, imaginary units, or formula_1, are numbers that can be represented by equations but refer to values that could not physically exist in real life. The mathematical definition of an imaginary unit is formula_2, which has the property formula_3.
p143
aVThe reason formula_1 was created was to answer a polynomial equation, formula_5, which normally has no solution as the value of x^2 would have to equal -1. Though the problem is solvable, the square root of -1 could not be represented by a physical quantity of any objects in real life.

p169
aVReal numbers.
p170
aVThe magnitude of a real number is usually called the absolute value or modulus. It is written | "x" |, and is defined by:
p171
aV | "x" | = "x", if "x" \u2265 0
p172
aV | "x" | = -"x", if "x" < 0

asS'Mathematical model'
p178
(lp179
VA mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of building a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, meteorology) and engineering disciplines (e.g. computer science, artificial intelligence). They are also used in the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology and political science). Physicists, engineers, statisticians, operations research analysts and economists use mathematical models a lot.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6550437&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6550437][http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&articleid=icn_2014_3_40_30195]

aVMathematical models can take many forms. The types of models include: 
p181
aVThese and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. Mathematical models can include logical models. In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models built on theory agree with results of repeatable experiments. When theoretical mathematical models do not match experimental measurements, scientists try to correct the model. Such corrections lead the way to better theories to explain the facts.

asS'Equivalence relation'
p183
(lp184
VThe equivalence relation is a mathematical relation that is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. Using this relation, it is possible to partition a set into (non-empty) subsets, which are called "equivalence classes". As an example, look at the animals on a farm: We now define a relation: we say that two animals are related, if they belong to the same species. That way, a cow is related to an ox, but not to a chicken. The relation we just defined is an equivalence relation:

(lp188
VThe pigeonhole principle explains that when there are (n) pigeon-sized holes in a pigeon container, then it's impossible to fit more than (n) pigeons in that container, without having at least one hole containing more than one. The pigeons are used here as an example for anything that can be put into containers or subdivisions.
p189
aVThis theorem is important in computer science and mathematics, especially in graph theory.
p190
aVExample.
p191
aVIn one suitcase there are 12 blue socks and 18 black socks. If we close our eyes, how many socks must we pull out to be sure we have a pair the same color?
p192
aVIf we think of the colors as 'holes' or categories, we have 2 holes, so (n) = 2. If we pull three socks from the suitcase, at least two of them must be the same color, because 3 is a number greater than 2. So the correct answer here is three.

According to George Pólya, combinatorics looks at counting the number of possibilities, and about the questions whether certain configurations exist, and how to get to them.

asS'Logarithmic scale'
p228
(lp229
VA logarithmic scale is a scale of measurement that uses the logarithm of a physical quantity instead of the quantity itself. On a logarithmic scale, each tick mark on the scale is the previous tick mark "multiplied" by some number. 
p230
aVThe logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values \u2013 the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range. 
p231
aVSome of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (multiplying the actual input strength adds a constant to the perceived signal strength, see: Stevens' power law). That makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular, our sense of hearing perceives equal "multiples" of frequencies as equal "differences" in pitch.
p232
aVOn most logarithmic scales, "small" multiples (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to "small" (possibly negative) values of the logarithmic measure. 
p233
aVExamples.
p234
aVWell-known examples of such scales are:
p235
aVSome logarithmic scales were designed such that "large" values (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to "small" values of the logarithmic measure. Examples of such scales are:
p236
aVGraphic representation.
p237
aVA logarithmic scale is also a graphical scale on one or both sides of a graph where a number "x" is printed at a distance "c"·log("x") from the point marked with the number 1. A slide rule has logarithmic scales, and nomograms often employ logarithmic scales. On a logarithmic scale an equal difference in order of magnitude is represented by an equal distance. The geometric mean of two numbers is midway between the numbers. 
p238
aVLogarithmic graph paper, before the advent of computer graphics, was a basic scientific tool. Plots on paper with one log scale can show up exponential laws, and on log-log paper power laws, as straight lines (see semilog graph, log-log graph).

asS'Exponential function'
p240
(lp241
VIn mathematics, an exponential function is a function that quickly grows. More precisely, it is the function formula_1, where e is Euler's constant, an irrational number that is approximately 2.71828. 
p242
aVProperties.
p243
aVBecause exponential functions use exponentiation, they follow the same rules. Thus,

aVThis may also seem unintuitive because of a fundamental property in differential calculus:
p248
aVformula_5, not formula_6 as it would follow the general rule of thumb (see differentiation)
p249
aVThis means that the slope of an exponential function is an exponential function itself, and subsequently this means it has a slope of 1 at formula_7. These properties are the reason it is an important function in mathematics.
p250
aVApplications.
p251
aVThe exponential function is among the most useful of mathematical functions. It is used to represent exponential growth, which has uses in virtually all science subjects and it is also prominent in Finance.
p252
aVExamples.
p253
aVOne example of an exponential function in real life would be interest in a bank. If a person deposits £100 into an account which gets 3% interest a month then the balance each month would be (assuming the money is untouched):
p254
aVNotice how the extra money from interest increases each month. The greater the original balance, the more interest the person will get.
p255
aVTwo mathematical examples of exponential functions are shown below.
p256
aVa=2
p257
aVa=3
p258
aVRelation to the mathematical constant "e".
p259
aVEven though the base (formula_8) can be any number bigger than zero, for example, 10 or 1/2, often it is a special number called e. The number "e" cannot be written exactly, but it is almost equal to 2.71828.
p260
aVThe number "e" is important to every exponential function. For example, a bank pays interest of 0.01 percent every day. One person takes his interest money and puts it in a box. After 10,000 days (about 30 years), he has 2 times as much money as he started with. Another person takes his interest money and puts it back into the bank. Because the bank now pays him interest on his interest, the amount of money is an exponential function. After 10,000 days, he does not have 2 times as much money as he started with, but he has 2.718145 times as much money as he started with. This number is very close to the number "e". If the bank pays interest more often, so the amount paid each time is less, then the number will be closer to the number "e".
p261
aVA person can also look at the picture to see why the number "e" is important for exponential functions. The picture has three different curves. The curve with the black points is an exponential function with a base a little smaller than "e". The curve with the short black lines is an exponential function with a base a little bigger than "e". The blue curve is an exponential function with a base exactly equal to "e". The red line is a tangent to the blue curve. It touches the blue curve at one point without crossing it. A person can see that the red curve crosses the "x"-axis, the line that goes from left to right, at -1. This is true only for the blue curve. This is the reason that the exponential function with the base "e" is special.
p262
asS'Logarithm'
p263
(lp264
VLogarithms or logs are a part of mathematics. They are related to exponential functions, and are useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.
p265
aVHistory.
p266
aVLogarithms were first used in India in the 2nd century BC. The first to use logarithms in modern times was the German mathematician Michael Stifel (around 1487-1567). In 1544, he wrote down the following equations: formula_1 and formula_2 This is the basis for understanding logarithms. For Stifel, formula_3 and formula_4 had to be whole numbers. John Napier (1550\u20131617) did not want this restriction, and wanted a range for the exponents.
p267
aVAccording to Napier, logarithms express ratios: formula_5 has the same ratio to formula_6 , as formula_7 to formula_8 if the difference of their logarithms matches. Mathematically: formula_9. At first, base e was used (even though the number had not been named yet). Henry Briggs proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms, such logarithms are very useful in astronomy.
p268
aVRelationship with exponential functions.
p269
aVA logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation
p270
aVJust as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts. The three parts of a logarithm are a base, an argument (also called power) and an answer.
p271
aVThis is an exponential function: 
p272
aV formula_10
p273
aVIn this function, the base is 2, the power is 3 and the answer is 8.
p274
aVThis exponential function has an inverse, this logarithm:
p275
aV formula_11
p276
aVIn this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.
p277
aVUses.
p278
aVLogarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easier because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.
p279
aVBefore calculators became cheap and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule, a tool with logarithms written on it.
p280
aVCommon logarithms.
p281
aVLogarithms to base 10 are called common logarithms. They are usually written without the base. For example:
p282
aV formula_12
p283
aVSome authors prefer the use of natural logarithms as formula_13 but usually mention this on preface pages.
p284
aVThis means:
p285
aV formula_14
p286
aVNatural logarithms.
p287
aVLogarithms to base "e" are called natural logarithms. The number e is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician Leonhard Euler.
p288
aVThe natural logarithms can take the symbols formula_15 or formula_16

aVLogarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications.
p313
aVBefore electronic computers, logarithms were used every day by scientists. Logarithms helped scientists and engineers in many fields such as astronomy.
p314
aVBefore computers, the "table of logarithms" was an important tool. In 1617, Henry Briggs printed the first logarithm table. This was soon after Napier's basic invention. Later, people made tables with better scope and precision. These tables listed the values of log"b"("x") and "b""x" for any number "x" in a certain range, at a certain precision, for a certain base "b" (usually "b" = 10). For example, Briggs' first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 8 digits. As the function is the inverse function of log"b"("x"), it has been called the antilogarithm. People used these tables to multiply and divide numbers. For example, a user looked up the logarithm in the table for each of two positive numbers. Adding the numbers from the table would give the logarithm of the product. The antilogarithm feature of the table would then find the product based on its logarithm.
p315
aVFor manual calculations that need precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier ways.
p316
aVMany logarithm tables give logarithms by separately providing the characteristic and mantissa of "x", that is to say, the integer part and the fractional part of log10("x"). The characteristic of is one plus the characteristic of "x", and their significands are the same. This extends the scope of logarithm tables: given a table listing log10("x") for all integers "x" ranging from 1 to 1000, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by
p317
aVformula_29
p318
aVAnother critical application was the slide rule, a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation, as illustrated here:
p319
aVNumbers are marked on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. Many engineers and scientists used slide rules until the 1970s. Scientists can work faster using a slide rule than using a logarithm table.

VIn mathematics a field is a certain kind of algebraic structure. In a field you can add (formula_1), subtract (formula_2), multiply (formula_3) and divide (formula_4) two numbers (with division only allowed if formula_5 is not equal to zero). A field is a special ring, in which you can divide.

aVThe law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known. This is known as triangulation. However, this calculation can have a numerical error if an angle is close to 90 degrees. The law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known. In some such cases, the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle. This is called an "ambiguous case".

(lp376
V"This is about distribution in a mathematical sense, other meanings can be found at distribution"
p377
aVIn mathematics, a distribution is a generalisation of a function. Distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by Laurent Schwartz, who received a Fields Medal for his work on them. The Fields medal is comparable to a Nobel Prize in mathematics, which does not exist. 
p378
aVDistributions were introduced to model certain concepts from Physics. Physics has the concept of a "mass of points in space". The Dirac delta function can model an electromagnetic charge of a point in space. The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere, except at one point, where it is infinitely large. This needs to be the case, because the density function needs to be 1. There is no function that can meet this criterion, except if integraton is taken as a "function" in the mathematical sense.

asS'Limit of a function'
p386
(lp387
VIn calculus, a branch of mathematics, the limit of a function is the behavior of a certain function near a selected input value for that function. Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations.
p388
aVDefinition of the limit.
p389
aVThe formal definition of the limit is as follows:
p390
aV"If the function formula_1 approaches a number formula_2 as formula_3 approaches a number formula_4, then formula_5
p391
aVThe notation for the limit above is read as "The limit of formula_1 as formula_3 approaches formula_4 is formula_2." Imagine we have a function such as formula_10. When formula_11, formula_1 is undefined, because formula_13. Therefore, on the Cartesian coordinate system, the function formula_10 would have a vertical asymptote at formula_11. In limit notation, this would be written as:
p392
aV"The limit of formula_16 as formula_3 approaches formula_18 is formula_19, which is denoted by formula_20
p393
aVRight and left limits.
p394
aVFor the function formula_10, we can get as close to formula_18 in the formula_3-values as we want, so long as we "don't" make formula_3 equal to formula_18. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_19, but without reaching it. The Left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the Right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function formula_10, since the limit for formula_3 is 0, if formula_30, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.

asVBanach\u2013Tarski paradox
p396
(lp397
VBanach\u2013Tarski paradox is a theorem in mathematics that says that any solid shape can be reassembled into any other solid shape. For example, a sphere can be split up into a limited number of parts which can then be put back together again to make two identical copies of the original sphere. The Banach-Tarski paradox can also be used to turn a small sphere into a huge sphere. It is important when thinking about this to realize that the parts that the solid shape is being split into are not solid shapes themselves; they are infinite sets of points spread around the solid shape. For the Banach-Tarski paradox to work, you need to use the axiom of choice.
p398
aVThe reason this is called a paradox is because no stretching or bending of the parts takes place and no new material is added yet by the end the volume can be doubled. This goes against our geometric intuition. However, it is mathematically possible and it turns out that in this case our intuition is not correct.
p399
asS'Square root'
p400
(lp401
VA square root of a number is a number that, when it is multiplied by itself (squared), gives the first number again. For example, 2 is the square root of 4, because 2×2=4. Only numbers bigger than or equal to zero have real square roots. A number bigger than zero has two square roots: one is positive (bigger than zero) and the other is negative (smaller than zero). For example, 4 has two square roots: 2 and \u22122. The only square root of zero is zero.
p402
aVSquare roots of negative numbers are not real numbers \u2013 they are imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers are basically numbers that cannot be square rooted and get a real result. Every complex number except 0 has 2 square roots. For example: \u22121 has two square roots. We call them formula_1 and formula_2.
p403
aVThe sign for a square root is made by putting a bent line over a number, like this: formula_3. We say "the square root of 4" (or whatever number we are taking the square root of).
p404
aVA whole number with a square root that is also a whole number is called a perfect square. The first few perfect squares are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1024, 1089, 1156, 1225...

aVOrigin of the Symbol.
p406
aVIt is not really known where the square root symbol formula_4 comes from, but some people believe that it was from the letter "r", which is the first letter of the Latin and German word "radix". Radix means root or base. Thus, radix quadratum from Latin refer most likely to the base of a square. As the sides of a square are all equal, the word radix may be interpreted as side of a square, even not literally meaning that.

p408
(lp409
VSurface area is the amount of space covering the outside of a three-dimensional (3D) object. The surface area of a polyhedron is found by finding the sum of the area of all of the faces. The surface area is found between many three-dimensional shapes using formulas.
p410
aVThe surface area is useful because it tells you how much material is required in order to cover the object\u2014for example, how much paint is needed to paint a table.Surface area is the sum of the faces, or surfaces, of a three dimensional shape.

(lp413
VThe theory of computation is a branch of mathematics. Generally it is seen as belonging to computer science. The field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. If this is the case, then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way. 
p414
aVThere are two major branches in it. The first is computability theory. It looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. Since this is a theoretical field of study, no real computers are used. They are replaced by a system called the Turing machine.
p415
aVOnce it is known if such a solution exists, computer scientists want to know if it can be found, and perhaps how it can be improved. This field of study is covered by the complexity theory. That theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another. Such methods are usually called algorithms.

asS'Big O notation'
p434
(lp435
VBig O Notation is a way of saying how much time it takes for a mathematical algorithm to run or how much memory it uses.
p436
aVThe Big O Notation is often used in identifying how complex a problem is (also known as the problem's complexity class).
p437
aVUse.
p438
aVIt is an expression that is meant to give a person a feel for the worst case time and/or space requirements of a program without them having to actually code and run the program on a real computer. This is also advantageous since different computers may have different hardware specifications and may produce the answer in different amounts of time should any program be run on them. The Big O notation, on the other hand, remains the same even if you're running a program on your desktop, a server or a supercomputer.
p439
aVLet us see how big O is used in practice. Consider for example that we're trying to find the maximum number from a given set of numbers. To find it, we have to look at each and every number in the set. If we were given twice the numbers, we would take twice as long to find the maximum number. Thus, finding the maximum in a set is formula_1 - the time or number of steps required to find an answer increases or decreases directly with increase or decrease in the size of the input. On the other hand, if an algorithm were said to be formula_2, then the time taken to produce the output would take a time that would square in magnitude with change in size of the input - for e.g. if someone gave an input that was twice as large as an initial input, the time taken would be formula_3 times as large.

aVNotice that when we're talking about Big O, we mean the big picture. We're not talking about how the time changes when we're given a set of 10 or 20 numbers (in fact the big O, due to its mathematical definition, may even give wrong bounds at these small scales). Instead, we're considering a huge bulk of data - talk about analyzing data from the Hubble Telescope, for example - where you have 120GB of data pouring in every week. In such situations, it becomes unnecessary to give the "exact" relation between the input and the size of growth. Thus you won't find expressions like formula_4 or formula_5 - the formula_6 in the first case and the formula_7 in the second case are trivial when compared to formula_8 and the formula_9 terms respectively. So, you simply write them as formula_1 and formula_2. Expressions like formula_12 and formula_13 are avoided as well, because what we need is a gist of how the time for the output changes with the input. So again the expressions are written as formula_1 and formula_2 (actually speaking, the provision for this coefficient is contained in the mathematical definition of the Big O). 
p441
aVLittle-o Notation: 
p442
aVA stricter version of the big O is the little-o. The difference between big O and little-o is that little-o is a strict upper bound. While the big O says that "the requirement may get as worse as this but not more", the little-o says that the "requirement will definitely not get worse than this". As an example, if I say that a program is formula_1, then it means that the time requirement may grow directly with the size of the input, but if I say that a program is formula_17, i.e. little-o of n, then I'm saying that the time requirement will definitely not grow directly in proportion to the size of the input, the growth rate is somewhere less than it. So in a way, formula_17 is better than formula_1, if we're seeking to reduce the time.

p444
(lp445
VIn mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also \u03bb-calculus, is a formal system. It was designed to investigate the definition of functions, and how to apply them. It is also a tool for analysing recursion. It was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. Lambda calculus can be used to define what a computable function is. No general algorithm can answer the question of whether two lambda calculus expressions are equivalent. This was the first question, even before the halting problem, for which undecidability could be proved. Lambda calculus has greatly influenced functional programming languages, such as LISP, ML and Haskell.
p446
aVLambda calculus can be called the smallest universal programming language. It consists of a single transformation rule (variable substitution) and a single function definition scheme. Lambda calculus is universal in the sense that any computable function can be expressed and evaluated using this formalism. It is thus the same as the Turing machine formalism. However, lambda calculus emphasizes the use of transformation rules. It does not care about the actual machine that implements them. It is an approach more related to software than to hardware.

asS'Manifold'
p448
(lp449
VA manifold is a concept from mathematics. Making a manifold is like making a flat map of a sphere (the Earth).
p450
aVThe Earth is a sphere, a three dimensional object of geometry. Yet, maps (two-dimensional representations) can be made of the Earth. At the edges of a certain map, the map needs to be changed. That way it is possible to make a two dimensional image of the whole surface of the Earth. There need to be rules, on how to change the maps, and some areas (near the edges of the map) will be on more than one map. It is not possible to make one map only, which would have no edges. This map would either have edges (and overlapping areas), or there would be some places where the paper was torn. 
p451
aVEach manifold has a dimension. This is the dimension of the maps, in the example above. It is the same for all maps. 
p452
asS'Map coloring'
p453
(lp454
VMap coloring is a term used for two different concepts: In geography and mapmaking it is used to say that colors are assigned to certain areas on a map. Examples of this are coloring that show the countries or divisions of a country, but also to visualize other data, for example the altitude. The other use is in mathematics: There it is used to describe the problem of finding the minimal number of colors needed to color a given map.
p455
asS'Exponentiation'
p456
(lp457
VExponentiation (power) is an arithmetic operation on numbers. It is repeated multiplication, just as multiplication is repeated addition. People write exponentiation with upper index. This looks like this: formula_1. Sometimes it is not possible. Then people write powers using the ^ sign: 2^3 means formula_2.
p458
aVThe number formula_3 is called base, and the number formula_4 is called exponent. For example, in formula_2, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.
p459
aVTo calculate formula_2 a person must multiply the number 2 by itself 3 times. So formula_7. The result is formula_8. The equation could be read out loud in this way: 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.
p460
aVExamples:
p461
aVIf the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called square because the area of a square is calculated using formula_12. So
p462
aVformula_13 is the square of formula_3
p463
aVIf the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called cube because the volume of a cube is calculated using formula_15. So
p464
aVformula_16 is the cube of formula_3
p465
aVIf the exponent is equal to -1 then the person must calculate the inverse of the base. So
p466
aVformula_18
p467
aVIf the exponent is an integer and is less than 0 then the person must invert the number and calculate the power. For example:
p468
aVformula_19
p469
aVIf the exponent is equal to formula_20 then the result of exponentiation is the square root of the base. So formula_21
p470
aVExample:
p471
aVformula_22
p472
aVSimilarly, if the exponent is formula_23 the result is the nth root, so:
p473
aVformula_24
p474
aVIf the exponent is a rational number formula_25, then the result is the "q"th root of the base raised to the power of "p", so:
p475
aVformula_26
p476
aVThe exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base "a" to an irrational "x"th power, we use an infinite sequence of rational numbers ("xi"), whose limit is x:
p477
aVformula_27
p478
aVlike this:
p479
aVformula_28

VA coordinate system is a system of numbers used to uniquely determine the position of a point. For two-dimensional systems, the numbers (scalars) are in ordered pairs. More dimensions call for more numbers. 
p485
asS'Random'
p486
(lp487
VRandom is a term used in mathematics (and less formally) to mean that there is no way to reliably predict an outcome (to know what will happen "before" it happens) or sense a pattern. Something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any conscious reason, and therefore thought to be purely by chance. An example of a random event is winning a lottery.
p488
aVA computer can make lists of apparently random numbers. Humans are unable to do this, because the brain works in patterns. If someone is asked to keep saying "heads" or "tails" at random, an astute human observer or properly programmed computer might eventually be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns.
p489
aVOn a website such as English Wikipedia the user can click on "Random page" to get a random article. The chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page.
p490
aVSometimes the word "random" is used more loosely. There are websites of random jokes, which just means: a variety of jokes about all sorts of things.
p491
aVIn recent years young people have started to use the word "random" even more loosely to describe anything which is rather strange or has no logic. Sentences such as "the mouldy cheese is escaping" or "I like pie and spam" might be described as "random", although this is not the proper dictionary or mathematical meaning of the word. 
p492
aVMaking random numbers.
p493
aVThere are several ways in which a process or system can be seen as "random":
p494
aVThe many applications of randomness have led to many different methods for generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or statistically random they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers.
p495
aVBefore there were computational random number generators, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work. Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables.
p496
aVComputers can make what appear to be random numbers. There are two ways to make them.

(lp501
VIn mathematics, a linear equation is a type of equation. In a linear equation, both terms have to be constant. A linear equation is the equation of a straight line. This type of equation is written in the form:
p502
aVy = mx + b OR (y - y1) = m(x - x1)
p503
aVWHERE
p504
aVm = the rate of change, or slope. The slope is how fast the line moves up or down. Larger numbers will make the slope steeper. If m is a negative number, then the line will appear to fall or go down the page when read from left to right. If m is a positive number, then the line will appear to climb the page when read from left to right.
p505
aVb = the y-intercept of the function. This is where the function crosses the y - axis of the coordinate plane.
p506
aVThe first equation is called slope-intercept form, because in it, the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are easily found.
p507
aVThe second equation is called point-slope form, because in it, a point on the graph (x1, y1) and the slope (m) are easily found.

asS'Unit circle'
p509
(lp510
VIn mathematics, a unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1. The equation of the unit circle is formula_1. The unit circle is centered at the Origin, or coordinates (0,0). It is often used in Trigonometry.
p511
aVTrigonometric functions in the unit circle.
p512
aVIn a unit circle, where formula_2 is the angle desired, formula_3 and formula_4 can be defined as formula_5 and formula_6. Using the function of the unit circle, formula_1, another equation for the unit circle is found, formula_8. When working with trigonometric functions, it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and formula_9 radians, or 0 through 90 degrees. It is possible to have higher angles than that, however. Using the unit circle, two identities can be found: formula_10 and formula_11 for any integer formula_12.

(lp515
VReal analysis is an area of mathematics that deals with sets and sequences of real numbers, as well as functions of one or more real variables. As one of the main branches of analysis, it can be seen as a subset of complex analysis. Many results in real analysis are special cases of results in complex analysis.

asS'Currying'
p523
(lp524
VCurrying is a technnique used in mathematics and computer science that consists of changing a function that takes several arguments into a number of functions that each take one argument. Mathematicians Moses Schönfinkel and Gottlob Frege laid the groundwork for this technique, which is named after Haskell Brooks Curry. Currying is used in Lambda calculus. Some programming languages, such as ML and Haskell say that functions can only have one argument.
p525
asS'Function composition'
p526
(lp527
VIn mathematics, function composition is a way to make a new function from two other functions.
p528
aVIf we let "f" be a function from "X" to "Y" and "g" be a function from "Y" to "Z" then we say that "g" composed with "f" is written as "g \u2218 f" a function from "X" to "Z" (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would it expect it to be as we will explain below).
p529
aVThe value of "f" given the input "x" is written as "f(x)". The value of "g \u2218 f" given the input "x" is written "(g \u2218 f)(x)" and is defined as "g(f(x))" (which means our way of writing "g" composed with "f" makes sense).
p530
aVHere is another example. Let "f" be a function which doubles a number (multiplies it by 2) and let "g" be a function which subtracts 1 from a number.
p531
aVThese would be written as:
p532
aVformula_1

asS'Strahler number'
p548
(lp549
VIn mathematics, the Strahler number or Horton\u2013Strahler number of any tree shape measures its complexity. It can be applied to any tree shape including real trees, lungs, human relationships and blood flow systems. These numbers allow these shapes to be handled in computer programming languages. These numbers were created to study the flow of liquids by Robert E. Horton and Arthur Newell Strahler.

asS"Spearman's rank correlation coefficient"
p551
(lp552
VIn mathematics and statistics, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient'" is a measure of correlation, named after its maker, Charles Spearman. It is written in short as the Greek letter "rho" (formula_1) or sometimes as formula_2. This means that it is a number that shows how closely two sets of data are linked. It only can be done on data that can be put in order, highest to lowest.
p553
aVThe general formula for formula_2 is formula_4.
p554
aVFor example, if you have data for how expensive different computers are, and data for how fast the computers are, you could see if they are linked, and how closely they are linked, using formula_2.
p555
aVWorking it out.
p556
aVStep one.
p557
aVTo work out formula_2 you first have to "rank" each piece of data. We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed.
p558
aVSo, the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1. The one higher than that would have 2. Then, it goes up until it is all ranked. You have to do this to both sets of data.Just use your mathematics skills my friend. Omar Zouaoui.
p559
aVStep two.
p560
aVNext, we have to find the "difference" between the two ranks. Then, you multiply the difference times itself, which is called squaring. The difference is called formula_9, and the number you get when you square formula_9is called formula_11.
p561
aVStep three.
p562
aVCount how much data we have. This data has ranks 1 to 5, so we have 5 pieces of data. This number is called formula_16.
p563
aVStep four.
p564
aVFinally, use everything we have worked out so far in this formula: formula_17.
p565
aVformula_18 means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column formula_11. This is because formula_20 means total.
p566
aVSo, formula_18 is formula_22 which is 4. The formula says multiply it by 6, which is 24.
p567
aVformula_23 is formula_24 which is 120.
p568
aVSo, to find out formula_2, we simply do formula_26.
p569
aVTherefore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.8 for this set of data.
p570
aVWhat the numbers mean.
p571
aVformula_2 always gives an answer between \u22121 and 1. The numbers between are like a scale, where \u22121 is a very strong link, 0 is no link, and 1 is also a very strong link. The difference between 1 and \u22121 is that 1 is a positive correlation, and \u22121 is a negative correlation. A graph of data with a formula_2 value of \u22121 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right.
p572
aVFor example, for the data that we did above, formula_2 was 0.8. So this means that there is a positive correlation. Because it is close to 1, it means that the link is strong between the two sets of data. So, we can say that those two sets of data are "linked", and go "up" together. If it was \u22120.8, we could say it was "linked" and as one goes up, the other goes down.
p573
aVIf two numbers are the same.
p574
aVSometimes, when ranking data, there are two or more numbers that are the same. When this happens in formula_2, we take the mean or average of the ranks that are the same. These are called "tied" ranks. To do this, we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied. Then, we add up all the ranks that they would have, and divide it by how many there are. For example, say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test.
p575
aVThese numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks.

asS'Structured program theorem'
p577
(lp578
VThe structured program theorem is a theory in programming and computer science. A computer program can be split into pieces of code that do a certain task. According to the structured program theory, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done.
p579
aVA program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily. These smaller tasks are called "subprograms" in computer science. According to the structured program theorem, the three ways subprograms can be combined are:
p580
aVThe theorem was first published in 1966 by Corrado Böhm and Guiseppe Jacopini. It comes from the 1946 description of the von Neumann architecture and the normal form theorem developed by Stephen Kleene.

asS'Limit (mathematics)'
p582
(lp583
VIn mathematics, a limit is the value that a function or sequence "approaches" or comes close to as the argument or index comes close to some value. Limits are very important in calculus (and mathematical analysis in general). They are used to define continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
p584
aVThe concept of a limit of a sequence can be generalised to the idea of a limit of a topological net. It is closely related to limit and direct limit in category theory.
p585
aVIn formulas, "limit" is usually abbreviated as lim as in lim("a""n") = "a". If an expression is approaching a limit, it is represented by the right arrow (\u2192) as in "a""n" \u2192 "a".

p587
(lp588
V"This article is about what computer scientists call an alphabet. There is an article about alphabets (as a writing system) at alphabet"
p589
aVIn computer science, an alphabet is a finite non-empty set. The elements of an alphabet are called the letters or symbols of the alphabet.
p590
aVAn example of an alphabet is formula_1 which may be used for Morse code or "{begin, if, else, for, while}" which may be the keywords of a Programming language.
p591
aVThe set of natural numbers is not an alphabet because as it is not finite.
p592
aVThe alphabet which is used the most in computer science is "{0,1}". It is called the binary alphabet because it contains two symbols. An alphabet can be used to make a string (or word). This is a finite Sequence of letters from the alphabet. For example a string of length 5 over "{0,1}" is "01101".
p593
aVThe empty string is the string containing no letters (it is often written as formula_2). The empty string is a string over any alphabet.
p594
aVIf we have an alphabet called formula_3. Then we write the set of "all" strings that can be made from formula_3 as formula_5. This is called the Kleene star (or Kleene closure) of formula_3. It is named after the mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene.
p595
aVThe Kleene star of the binary alphabet is formula_7. The three dots after 001, show that we cannot write the Kleene star of an alphabet in full because it is an infinite set. 
p596
aVAlphabets are important because they are used in studying formal languages, finite automata and very difficult questions in computer science about what can be computed and what can not.

asS'Entscheidungsproblem'
p598
(lp599
VThe Entscheidungsproblem (German, "decision problem") is a famous problem of mathematics. David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language, and a logical statement in that language, and that will output "True" or "False", depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct.
p600
aVIn 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem.

asS'Algorithmic information theory'
p602
(lp603
VAlgorithmic information theory is a field of theoretical computer science. It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .
p604
aVExample.
p605
aVAccording to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):
p606
aV1000110111100101
p607
aV1111111100000000
p608
aVThe first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times "1", then eight times "0"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten ("compress") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten ("compress") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value. 
p609
asS'Order theory'
p610
(lp611
VOrder theory is a field of mathematics. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a set. Given a binary relation it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order. It is also possible to say that a certain element "comes before" another one, for that relation. Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is "smaller than" the other.
p612
aVFor a specific set to be ordered it must be:
p613

VDynamical systems theory is a field of applied mathematics. It tries to describe complex dynamical systems, often using differential equations and difference equations. When differential equations are used, the theory is called "continuous" dynamical systems theory. When difference equations are used, it is called "discrete" dynamical systems theory.
p622
aVThe theory looks at the long-term behaviour of dynamical systems. It also studies solutions to the equations of motion, mainly for mechanical systems. The study also includes the motion of planets, or electronic circuits. Part of it focuses on solving Partial differential equations that occur in biology.

asS'Binary operation'
p624
(lp625
VIn mathematics, a binary operation, often denoted *, on a set is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set. For example, if we take a pair of natural numbers and let the operation * be addition, then their sum is also a natural number, and is the result of applying this particular binary operation. Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication. For instance, take the natural numbers 2 and 3. When multiplied together they give 6, another natural number.

asS'Dependent and independent variables'
p628
(lp629
VIn an experiment, the variables used can be classed as either dependent or independent variables. The "dependent" variable is the possible outcome of the experiment; the effect. It depends on what happens to other variables in the experiment. The dependent variable is basically the part that you are changing. For example, if you want to know how much light a plant needs to grow, the amount of growth is the dependent. If you wanted to see if a plant would grow better in hot or cold areas your dependent variable would be the temperature of the area the plant is left in.
p630
aVThe "independent" variable is the variable that you have control over, what you can choose and manipulate. It is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable. In some cases, you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable. It may be something that is already there and is fixed, something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else, the dependent variable like color, kind, time. As an example, you are interested in how stress affects heart rate in humans. Your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate. You can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate.
p631
aVMathematics.
p632
aVIn mathematics, the dependent variable changes with the independent variable, hence the name (it depends on the independent variable).
p633
aVIn calculus, a function is a map whose action is specified on variables. Take "x" and "y" to be two variables. A function "f" may map "x" to some expression in "x". Assigning gives a relation between "y" and "x". If there is some relation specifying "y" in terms of "x", then y is known as a dependent variable (and "x" is an independent variable).
p634
aVA dependent variable is also known as a "response variable", "regressand", "measured variable", "responding variable", "explained variable", "outcome variable", "experimental variable", and "output variable".

aVFormulas use letters instead of words. A simple example of a formula is y = x. Here, if x is, for example, 1, then y = x so y = 1. Possibly the most famous formula is e = m × c 2. Albert Einstein created this. In it, e is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. Thus, energy = mass × (multiplied by) the speed of light 2 (squared). The multiplication sign is usually left out, giving e = mc 2.
p640
aVThe formula e = mc 2 is also an equation. Every equation is a formula, but not every formula is an equation. For instance, the formula x\u2261y (x "is defined as" y) is not an equation because no "=" sign is used.
p641
asS'Percentage'
p642
(lp643
VPercent means "out of one hundred". It is often shown with the symbol "%". It is used even if there are not a hundred items. The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred. 
p644
aVPercentages are one way of writing numbers; you can also write percentages as fractions or decimals. 
p645
aVFor example, I have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange. The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4 = 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%.
p646
aVThere are ways to convert fractions to percentages or decimals to percentages.
p647
aVUses.
p648
aVPercentages are useful because people can compare things that are not out of the same number. For example, exam marks are often percentages, so people can compare them even if there are more questions on one exam paper than the other.
p649
asS'Y-intercept'
p650
(lp651
VThe y-intercept of a line on a graph is where the line touches (or intercepts) the y-axis (the numbered line going straight up).
p652
aVThe equation for straight lines is formula_1. "formula_2" is the formula_3-intercept.
p653
asS'Parameter'
p654
(lp655
VIn some non-technical contexts or in jargon, "parameter" may simply be a synonym for criterion.
p656
aVIn mathematics, statistics, and the mathematical sciences, parameters (L: "auxiliary measure") are quantities that define certain relatively constant characteristics of systems or functions. 
p657
aVMost commonly represented \u03b8 in general form, other symbols carry standard, specific meanings. When evaluating the function over a domain or determining the response of the system over a period of time, the independent variables are modulated, while the parameters are held constant. The function or system may then be reevaluated or reprocessed with different parameters, to give a function or system with different behavior. 
p658
aVLoosely speaking, the term parameter is used for an argument which is intermediate in status between a variable and a constant.
p659
aVExample.
p660
aVSuppose that you and a friend are both working for the same boss making the same money working the same hours, that the formula would become:
p661
aVEngineering.
p662
aVIn engineering (especially involving data acquisition) the term "parameter" sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. For example an airliner flight data recorder may record 88 different items, each termed a parameter. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term "channel" refers to an individual measured item, with "parameter" referring to the setup information about that channel.
p663
aV"Speaking generally, properties are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; parameters are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal." John D. Trimmer, 1950, Response of Physical Systems (New York: Wiley), p. 13.
p664
aVThe term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences. The data that one computer program gives to another are sometimes called parameters.
p665
asS'Monster group'
p666
(lp667
VIn math, there are many subjects. One of these is group theory. In group theory, the Monster group (shortened to "M" or "F"1) is important. It is also called the Fischer-Griess Monster, or the Friendly Giant. It is a group of finite order, which is equal to:
p668
aV   246 · 320 · 59 · 76 · 112 · 133 · 17 · 19 · 23 · 29 · 31 · 41 · 47 · 59 · 71

p670
aV \u2248 8 · 1053.
p671
aVIt is a "simple group". Simple groups have only two normal subgroups: the identity element, and "M".
p672
aVThe finite simple groups have been completely classified (the classification of finite simple groups). There are two kinds of finite simple groups in the list of finite simple groups. The first kind has 18 countably infinite families. The second kind has 26 sporadic groups. They are not as systematic. The Monster group is the largest of these sporadic groups. It contains all but six of the other sporadic groups inside of it. Robert Griess has called these six exceptions pariahs. The rest make up the happy family.
p673
asS'3D'
p674
(lp675
V3D (or 3-D) means three-dimensional, or having three dimensions. For example, a box is three-dimensional; it is solid, and not thin like a piece of paper. It has volume, a top and bottom, left and right (sides), as well as a front and back. You can turn the box around to view it from another side (called a face, surface or simply side).
p676
aVA dimension is measurable in inches, microns, miles, kilometers, or any other unit of length.
p677
aVThe three dimensions are often called length (or depth), width (or breadth), and height. Some purposes use other words. 
p678
aV3D graphics are used to make video games or animated movies. A lot of calculations are needed to make pictures seem three-dimensional on a screen. Modern computers usually have a GPU (graphics processing unit) to handle these calculations.
p679
aVIn mathematics.
p680
aVIn the Cartesian coordinate system, length, width, and height are given letters (variables) to make them easier to write, or if a value is not known. Often X is width, Y is height, and Z is length. Another common 3D coordinate system uses spherical coordinates.
p681
aVThe mathematical study of shapes and dimensions is called geometry. Geometry can be used to find things such as volume, area, and how tall a mountain is.
p682
aVTime.
p683
aVSome people see time as a fourth dimension. It is also measured. It is measured in units of time such as seconds, hours, years, or any other measurement of time.

asS'Identity (mathematics)'
p685
(lp686
V"For other senses of this word, see identity."
p687
aVIn mathematics, the term identity has several important uses:
p688
aVAn equality in mathematical sense is only true under more particular conditions. For this, the symbol \u2261 is sometimes used. (However, this can lead to misunderstandings since the same symbol can also be used for a congruence relation.)

aVA common example of the first meaning is the trigonometric identity

asVGödel number
p725
(lp726
VIn formal number theory a Gödel numbering is a function which assigns to each symbol and formula of some formal language a unique natural number called a Gödel number (GN). The concept was first used by Kurt Gödel for the proof of his incompleteness theorem. 
p727
aVA Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an encoding where a number is assigned to each symbol of a mathematical notation, and a stream of natural numbers can then represent some form or function. A numbering of the set of computable functions can then be represented by a stream of Gödel numbers (also called effective numbers). Rogers' equivalence theorem states criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions are Gödel numberings.

p734
aVOne of the simplest Gödel numbering schemes is used every day: The correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence 2 3 is understood, by a particular set of rules, to correspond to the number twenty-three. Similarly, strings of symbols from some alphabet of "N" symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to "N" and reading the string as the base "N"+1 representation of an integer.
p735
asS'Strict weak ordering'
p736
(lp737
VStrict weak ordering is a binary relation on a set. Such relations define a strict ordering, but they contain several elements of the same type. An example might be the relation "costs less than", or "is cheaper than". For any two elements that are "of different types", the relation holds. On the other hand, there are some elements that cannot be ordered that way, because they are of the same type. An example for such a relation may be the relation, "costs less than": milk may "cost less than" bread, and bread may cost less than cake. Two items of different types may cost less than another, but they can otherwise have the same price.
p738
aVTwo different algorithms that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters, but they will always give an ordering where the four-letter words come before the five-letter-words, and after the three-letter-words.
p739
aVTime will give a strict weak ordering too; Events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen at the same time.
p740
asS'Proportionality'
p741
(lp742
V "For the math equations, see: Proportions".
p743
aVA proportion (adjective: proportionate) is a relationship between two quantities or numbers. A proportion can be expressed as a word, for example, one man may be described as "smaller" than another man. A proportion can usually be expressed more accurately by "numbers". For example, the proportion, or mathematical relationship, between one man and two men can be written as the numbers "1/2", which is also known as a fraction or ratio. For equations of ratios, see: Proportions.
p744
asS'Base (mathematics)'
p745
(lp746
VIn mathematics, a base or radix is the number of different digits that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because "dec" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9.
p747
aVA base can be any whole number bigger than 0 (if it was 0, then there would be no digits). Sometimes, to show that a number is in a different base to the decimal system, the base that it is in is typed after it, smaller than the number. For instance, formula_1 means 23 in base 8 (which is equal to 19 in base 10). Most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.
p748
aVUses of bases.
p749
aVIn computers.
p750
aVDifferent bases are often used in computers. Binary (base 2) is used because at the most simple level, computers can only deal with 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal (base 16) is used because of how computers group binary digits together. Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them. Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are shown as A, B, C, D, E, and F.
p751
aVMeasurement.
p752
aVThe oldest systems of counting used base one. Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting. Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix (base twelve). This is shown in English, as there are words such as dozen (12) and gross; 144 = 12(12), and lengths such as feet (12 inches).bases are used as a converter for various numbers.
p753
aVWriting bases.
p754
aVWhen typing a base, the small number which shows how many digits in that base is usually in base 10. This is because if the radix was written in the base it is, it would always be 10, so there would be no way of knowing what base it was. 
p755
aVNumbers in different bases.
p756
aVHere are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases.

asS'Universe of discourse'
p758
(lp759
VIn mathematics, the universe of discourse or domain of discourse is a set of all elements to which a function applies. A variable can take any of the values in its universe of discourse. 
p760
aVThe term is also used informally. 
p761
aV"In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse".

asS"Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel"
p763
(lp764
VHilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel'" is a mathematical paradox named after the German mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert used it as an example to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do.
p765
aVNormal hotels have a set number of rooms. This number is finite. Once every room has been assigned to a guest, any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served - in other words, the hotel is fully booked. Now suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. As a convenience, the rooms have numbers, the first room has the number 1, the second has number 2, and so on. If all the rooms are filled, it might appear that no more guests can be taken in, as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms. This is wrong, though. A room can be provided for another guest. This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. In the general case, the guest in room "n" will be moved to room "n+1". After all guests have moved, room 1 is empty, and the new guest now has a room to occupy. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.
p766
aVIn case of infinitely new guests.
p767
aVAnother thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside, again when all the rooms are already full. This is done by asking each guest to multiply their room number by two and move to that room. (If their previous room number was "n", this time they would move to room number "2n".) This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, the guest in room 4 to room 8, and so on. After finishing, we find that all the rooms with the odd numbers are empty. Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms. Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger.
p768
aVIf infinite groups of infinite guests come.
p769
aVThe guest at room 11 would move to room 101.
p770
aVThe second person of group 5 (Address 5-2) would go to room 25.
p771
aVThis is not really a paradox, it is only counterintuitive. In a normal hotel, with a finite number of rooms, the number of "odd-numbered" rooms, is smaller than the total number of rooms. In Hilbert's Hotel this does not seem to be the case.

asS'Group theory'
p790
(lp791
VIn mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, and of addition and multiplication of numbers. Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in physics and chemistry.
p792
aVDefinition.
p793
aVA group is a set (collection) "G" whose members are called "elements". The elements can be numbers of some kind, or other abstract objects. The elements can even be material objects. There is also a "binary operation" which combines any two elements of "G" and results in another element of "G". This new element may be different from either of the original two, but it does not have to be. It only has to be an element of "G". To be a group, the following four conditions must be true of "G" and the operation defined over "G":
p794
aVAn important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result. This means that "a" \u2022 "b" = "b" \u2022 "a" does not hold. If the order does not matter and the previous equation does hold, the group is called an abelian group.
p795
aVExamples.
p796
aVOne example of a group is the set of integers (called Z) with the addition operator +. This group is called "G" = (Z, +). Each required condition is true of "G", so "G" is a group.
p797
aVThe addition operator is also commutative \u2013 the order of "a" and "b" does not matter. For any two integers "a" and "b" in G, "a" + "b" = "b" + "a". Thus, "G" is also an abelian group.
p798
asS'Right-hand rule'
p799
(lp800
VThe right-hand rule is a convention in vector math. It helps you remember direction when vectors get cross multiplied.
p801
aV# Start by closing your right hand and stick out your pointer finger.
p802
aV# Stick your thumb straight up like a your making the sign for a gun.
p803
aV# If you point your "gun" straight ahead, stick out your middle finger so that it points left and all your fingers are at right angles to each other.
p804
aVIf you have two vectors that you want to cross multiply, you can figure out the direction of the vector that comes out by pointing your thumb in the direction of the first vector and your pointer in the direction of the second vector. Your middle finger will point the direction of the cross product.
p805
aVRemember that when you change the order that vectors get cross multiplied, the result goes in the opposite direction. So it's important to make sure that you go in the order of formula_1.
p806
aVVariations.
p807
aVThere is another rule called the right-hand grip rule (or corkscrew rule) that is used for magnetic fields and things that rotate. 
p808
aV# Start by putting your right hand out flat and point your thumb straight out so that it is at a right angle to your other fingers.
p809
aV# Now curl your fingers into a fist and keep your thumb out (like a Thumbs Up).
p810
aV# Match how your fingers curl in to the way something is moving. The direction that your thumb is pointing is the direction of the vector we use to talk about it.
p811
aVYou can do this in reverse by starting your thumb in the direction of the vector and see how your fingers curl to see the direction of rotation. If you point your thumb in the direction of current in a wire, the magnetic field that comes up around it is in the direction of your curling fingers.

VHomotopies are studied in a branch of mathematics known as Algebraic Topology. A homotopy is a deformation (change of form) of one thing into another without cutting it. For example, if we imagine a stretchy object, then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are "homotopy equivalent". One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut. To a topologist, these two shapes are the same.

asS'Continuous function'
p822
(lp823
VIn mathematics a function is said to be continuous if, roughly said, a "small change" in the input only causes a "small change" in the output. If this is not the case, the function is said to be discontinuous. Functions defined on the real numbers, with one input and one output variable, will show as an "uninterrupted line (or curve)". They can be drawn "without lifting the pen". The definition given above was made by Augustin-Louis Cauchy.
p824
aVKarl Weierstraß gave another definition of continuity: Suppose that there is a function "f", defined on the real numbers. At the point formula_1 the function will have the value formula_2. If the function is continuous at formula_1, then for every value of formula_4 no matter how small it is, there is a value of formula_5, so that whenever formula_6, that makes formula_7. Intuitively: Given a point close to formula_1 (called x), the "absolute value" of the difference between the two values of the function can be made arbitrarily small, if the point x is "close enough" to formula_1.
p825
aVThere are also special forms of continuous, such as "Lipschitz-continuous". A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a formula_10 with formula_11 for all x,y \u2208 (a,b).
p826
asS'Halting problem'
p827
(lp828
VThe Halting problem is a problem in computer science. The problem is looking at a computer program and finding out if the program is going to run forever or not. We say that a program "solves the halting problem" if it can look at any other program and tell if that other program will run forever or not.
p829
aVFor example, a program like this:
p830
aVwill loop forever, but the program
p831
aVstops very quickly.
p832
aVIs there a program that solves the halting problem? It turns out there is not. We prove this fact by showing that if there is a program that solves the halting problem then something impossible happens. So for the moment we will act like there really is a program that solves the halting problem. We will call it P.
p833
aVP can look at any program and find out if it will run forever or not. We use P to make a new program that we will call Q. What Q does is look at another program and then answer the following question: "If we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, will it run forever?". We can make Q because we have P. All we need to do is to tell Q to create a new program that is the old program looking at itself, and then use P to find out if the new program runs forever or not.
p834
aVNow we make another program R. R looks at another program and asks Q for its answer on that program. If Q answers "yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever", then R stops. If Q answers "no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, it will not run forever", then R enters an infinite loop and runs forever.
p835
aVNow we look at what happens if we make R look at a copy of itself. Two things can happen: it will either stop or run forever. 
p836
aVIf running R and making it look at a copy of itself does not run forever, then Q answered "yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: "yes, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever". So: If R running on a copy of itself does not run forever, then it does run forever. This is impossible.
p837
aVIf running R and making it look at a copy of itself runs forever, then Q answered "no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: "no, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever". So: If R running on a copy of itself runs forever, then it does not run forever. This is also impossible.
p838
aVNo matter what happens, we get an impossible situation. We did something wrong, and we need to find out what it was. Most of the things we did were not wrong. We can not say "making a program look at a copy of itself is wrong", or "looking at what another program said and then going into a loop if it said one thing, and stopping if it said another thing" is wrong. It does not make sense to say that we are not allowed to do those things. The only thing that we did that looks like it could be wrong is that we pretended that a program like P exists in the first place. And since this is the only thing that could be wrong, and something must be wrong, this is it. This is the proof that a program like P does not exist.

(lp852
VA permutation is a single way of arranging a group of objects. It is useful in mathematics. 
p853
aVA permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation. If some of them chose different seats, it would be a different permutation.
p854
aVPermutations without repetitions.
p855
aVThe factorial has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions. The number n! is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order. For example, if we have three fruit: an orange, apple and pear, we can eat them in the order mentioned, or we can change them e.g. an apple, then a pear and finally an orange. The exact number of permutations is then formula_1. The number gets extremely large as the number of items (n) goes up.
p856
asS'Automaton'
p857
(lp858
VAn Automaton (one automaton, several "automata") is a concept from mathematics. Sometimes the concept is called "state machine". It is like an abstract machine. 
p859
aVSuch a machine can be given "input", which is either rejected, or accepted. It's like a vending machine. When something is bought, coins (or money) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected.
p860
aVInternally, the automaton has different "states" it can be in. Feeding it input may (or may not) change its state. That way, the automaton goes through all the input, consuming one item (which mathematicians call a symbol) at a time. When no symbol is left, the automaton is in a certain state. This may be an "final state". In this case the input is accepted. Otherwise, the input is rejected.
p861
aVIf the machine has a countable, finite number of states, it is called "finite state machine". A diagram that shows all the states, and transitions of such a machine is called finite state diagram.
p862
aVProblems.
p863
aVLike in real life, there are machines that are too complex to understand. The mathematician and computer scientists therefore ask themselves if a certain automaton is "minimal". If it is not minimal, there must be another automaton with fewer states that can do the same thing. An example of an automaton is the turing machine.
p864
asS'Equality (mathematics)'
p865
(lp866
VIn mathematics, two things are equal if and only if they are exactly the same in every way. That is, they have the same (mathematical) value, and the same mathematical properties. Mathematicians use the equals sign (=) to say this. This defines a binary relation, equality. The statement ""x" = "y"" means that "x" and "y" are equal.
p867
aVEquivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an equivalence relation between two sets, that is, the two sets have exactly the same elements. The sets do not need to be finite to be equal. A statement that two expressions denote equal quantities is an equation. Equations are equal. Inequalities are unequal.
p868
aVSince a predicate is a way of describing something that is true, another way to say this is that if you can find something that is true about one variable but not true about the other variable, then they are not "equal", as far as mathematical logic is concerned.
p869
aVHere is a simple way of saying that: if two things are equal, anything that is true about one of them has to be true about the other one. 
p870
aVIn geometry, the word congruence is often preferred. Numbers are equal, geometrical objects are congruent. Two shapes are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is. If you have to shrink or enlarge one of the two objects, they are not congruent. They are called "similar"
p871
aVIn computer science, usually, the mathematical definition is used. Very often, the comparison is written "==" (and the assignment, i.e. giving a value, is written "=", or ":="). In object-oriented languages, or languages which have pointers, there is an additional problem. Those languages contain references (which are in fact pointers). If two such references do not reference exactly the same object, they are different. "a == b" will be false, for this case.
p872
aVFor this reason, many such languages have introduced another operator (in Java, this method is called "equals"). This operator compares the actual values of the objects, not where the variables that reference them point to.
p873
aVIn social sciences, two people are equal if many of the same things are true about them. Two people who have the same amount of education and money and are the same age usually think of each other as equals. Another name for a person who is equal to another person is a peer.

VIn 1900, the mathematician David Hilbert published a list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems. The list of problems turned out to be very influential. After Hilbert's death, another problem was found in his writings; this is sometimes known as Hilbert's 24th problem today. This problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible.

aVPascal's Triangle is a mathematical triangular array. It is named after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, but it was used in China 3 centuries before his time.
p891
aVPascal's triangle can be made as follows. On the first row, write only the number 1. Then, to get the numbers of following rows, add the number that can be seen above and to the left (if any) and the number above and to the right (if any) to find the new value. For example, the numbers 1 and 3 in the fourth row are added to make 4 in the fifth row.

aVNot all functions have inverse functions. Finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do.
p950
asS'Probability'
p951
(lp952
VProbability is a part of mathematics. It has to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. 
p953
aVFor example, using probability, you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side. Often people call the side with the face "heads", and the other side "tails".
p954
aVThe probability (p) of an event is always between zero (impossible) and one (certain).
p955
aVIf we roll a die (plural: dice), then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 (This is because there are 6 numbers on a die). Also, the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6. This is because it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 
p956
aVThe chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. Every time we roll the die, it will always land on a number between 1 and 6.
p957
aVProbability can be figured out using mathematics. For example if you roll six dice, the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious, but can be figured out using math and science.
p958
aVOne of the most interesting things about chance is that to figure out the probability that two things will both happen you multiply their two probabilities together. For instance, suppose that you want to know the probability of rolling two dice and getting a certain combination (it could be two 6s or a 3 then a 5, just any two). The possibility of getting a 3 is one in six (\u2159) and the possibility of getting a 5 is also one in six, so the chances of getting a 3 then a 5 is \u2159×\u2159=\u215f36. If that number is expressed as somewhere between 0 and 1, it equals 0.027...7, which is fairly low. The possibility of getting a 3, then a 5, and then a 2 would be \u2159×\u2159×\u2159=\u215f216 or 0.00463, which is a much lower probability.

asS'Idempotence'
p964
(lp965
VIdempotence is a property that an operation in mathematics or computer science may have. It roughly means that the operation can be carried out again and again without changing the result.
p966
aVThe word idempotence was made by Benjamin Pierce because he saw the concept when studying algebra.
p967
aVThe meaning is different if we are talking about different kinds of operations. It can also be used to describe elements than an operation can take:
p968
aVWe say that an element "c" in the domain of "f" is an idempotent element if "f(f(c)) = f(c)". This means that "f" is idempotent if every element of its domain is an idempotent element.
p969
aVWe say that an element "c" which "*" can take is an idempotent element for "*" if "c * c = c". For example, the number "1" is an idempotent element for multiplication because "1" times "1" is "1".
p970
aVExamples in the real world.
p971
aVIf a call button inside an elevator is pressed then the elevator will go to the floor that is on the button. If it is pressed again then it will do the same thing. This means that the operation of pressing a button to make the elevator change floors is an idempotent operation.
p972
aVIf we mix two pots which have the same liquid in them into a new pot then we will have the same liquid in that pot. If we only care about "what" kind of liquid is in the pot (not how much) then mixing liquids is an idempotent binary operation.
p973
aVThe face of a clock looks the same if 12 hours have passed. So for the operation of "letting time pass on a clock" we see that letting 12 hours pass is an idempotent element (this is also true for all multiples of 12 like 24, 36, 48, ...).

p981
aVDisagreement.
p982
aVAn argument is also a disagreement between two people in a conversation. 
p983
aVThe verb is to argue. When people say that someone is "arguing", it can mean that the person is becoming very annoyed, but it does not have to mean that. "To argue with someone" can also mean that someone is becoming annoyed. Someone who is always arguing with people is argumentative.
p984
aV"To argue" may simply mean "to debate", "to discuss", usually between people of differing opinions. "The lawyer argued the case" (he gave reasons why he thought the person was guilty or not guilty). Most people get into arguments (become annoyed) at times, but it is much better to try to agree with someone by discussing the arguments (reasons) thoughtfully. Sometimes an argument can be settled by each person making a compromise (an arrangement in which each side gives up something).
p985
aVArguments can escalate (get worse). Then they are disputes. Disputes can escalate into conflicts. Conflicts may escalate into violence. But arguments can also disappear or get resolved. People can listen, learn, and see the other point of view. They can be helped by discussion, mediation or negotiation.

(lp990
VCharge conjugation describes a type of symmetry of nature. To preform a charge conjugation, one would exchange all particles with their corresponding antiparticles. This action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the electromagnetic charge would be reversed. For example, one could make an antihydrogen atom with an antiproton and an antielectron. This would result in an atom with a negatively charged nucleus orbited by a positively charged positron. The masses of the nucleus and the lepton orbiting the nucleus would remain unchanged. If the behavior of the system (such as the atom mentioned above) remains unchanged after charge conjugation, the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation. This symmetry is also known as "C symmetry."

p994
aVThus an airliner in flight is dynamically stable, and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure (wind). To change its direction, its control system must be altered. On the other hand, a fighter plane is unstable, and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the pilot and a computer.

p1023
(lp1024
VThe Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in probability (chance). The problem is based on a television game show from the United States, "Let's Make a Deal". It is named for the host of this show, Monty Hall.
p1025
aVIn the problem, there are three doors. A car (prize of high value) is behind one door and goats (booby prizes of low value) behind the other two doors. First, the player chooses a door but does not open it. Then the host, who has knowledge of what is behind every door, opens a different door which they are certain has a goat behind it (opening either door with equal chances if the car is behind the player's door). Last, the host lets the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change choices to the third door (the one the host did not open). The rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind and has to let the player switch. The question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car.
p1026
aVThe chances of the car being behind the two doors that are still closed seem equal, so most people say changing choices does not increase the chances of getting the car. The true answer is that changing choices increases the chances of getting the car from 1/3 (one out of three) to 2/3 (two out of three).
p1027
aVThat comes from the fact that the player, by choosing one door out of three, has a one chance in three of selecting the door with the car. The chance of the car being somewhere behind the other two doors is two out of three. So to improve their chance of winning a car, the player if given the choice, should swap their one door for the other two doors right away. But wait! The host then tries to confuse the player by opening one of their own goat doors. That changes nothing, remember that the player is still swapping their one door for the other two doors (even though one of them has been opened).
p1028
aVThese are the options:
p1029
aV1. (Lose): If the player picks the car, then the host will show a goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a goat .
p1030
aV2. (Win) : If the player picks a goat, then the host will show the other goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.
p1031
aV3. (Win) : If the player picks the other goat, then the host will show the first goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.

This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio. Two common ways of writing it are sa/vol or SA:V.

asS'Reed-Solomon error correction'
p1048
(lp1049
VReed-Solomon error correction is an error-correcting code. It works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The polynomial is evaluated at several points, and these values are sent or recorded. Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined. As long as it receives "many" of the points correctly, the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a "few" bad points. 
p1050
aVReed-Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications, for example in CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, in data transmission technologies such as DSL & WiMAX, and broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC.
p1051
aVOverview.
p1052
aVReed-Solomon codes are block codes. This means that a fixed block of input data is processed
p1053
aVinto a fixed block of output data. In the case of the most commonly used R-S code (255, 223) \u2013 223 Reed-Solomon input symbols (each eight bits long) are encoded into 255 output symbols.
p1054
aVThe Reed-Solomon code, like the convolutional code, is a transparent code. This means that if
p1055
aVthe channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line, the decoders will still
p1056
aVoperate. The result will be the complement of the original data. However, the Reed-Solomon
p1057
aVcode loses its transparency if virtual zero fill is used. For this reason it is mandatory that the
p1058
aVsense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed-Solomon decoding.
p1059
aVIn the case of the Voyager program R-S codes reach near optimal performance when concatenated with the (7, 1/2) convolutional (Viterbi) inner code. Since two check symbols are required for each error to be corrected, this results in a total of 32 check symbols and 223 information symbols per codeword.
p1060
aVIn addition, the Reed-Solomon codewords can be interleaved on a symbol basis before being
p1061
aVconvolutionally encoded. Since this separates the symbols in a codeword, it becomes less likely
p1062
aVthat a burst from the Viterbi decoder disturbs more than one Reed-Solomon symbol in any one
p1063
aVcodeword.
p1064
aVBasic idea.
p1065
aVThe key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any "k" distinct points "uniquely" determine a polynomial of degree at most "k"-1. 
p1066
aVThe sender determines a degree formula_1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the formula_2 data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than "k" points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
p1067
aVIn the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
p1068
aVHistory.
p1069
aVThe code was invented in 1960 by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon, who were then members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Their seminal article was entitled "Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields." When it was written, digital technology was not advanced enough to implement the concept. The first application, in 1982, of RS codes in mass-produced products was the compact disc, where two interleaved RS codes are used. An efficient decoding algorithm for large-distance RS codes was developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and James Massey in 1969. Today RS codes are used in hard disk drive, DVD, telecommunication, and digital broadcast protocols.

VRandom sampling is a way of sampling data. In a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. For instance, to do an election poll, calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people only at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention. A page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting, so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected. But neither sample is really random because for one thing, some people do not have phones.

(lp1075
VCategory theory is a type of mathematics. Category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are the same. For example, some ideas from topology and abstract algebra are similar. Ideas in category theory are written down in formulas or diagrams. Category theory can be used to make computer programs more secure or easy to write.
p1076
aVA category is a mathematical object. It can be drawn with dots and arrows. Each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot. There can be many dots, sometimes so many that you can not count them. An arrow is the abstract idea of a function and the dots are the domain and codomain of the function.
p1077
aVComposition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows. If two arrows form an elbow shape, then they have a composition arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second. Composition obeys some axioms, or equations.

p1097
(lp1098
VIn vector calculus, the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field, and whose magnitude is the greatest rate of change.
p1099
aVA generalization of the gradient, for functions which have vectorial values, is the Jacobian. 
p1100
aVInterpretations of the gradient.
p1101
aVConsider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field formula_1, so at each point formula_2 the temperature is formula_3. We will assume that the temperature does not change in time. Then, at each point in the room, the gradient at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly. The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.
p1102
aVConsider a hill whose height above sea level at a point formula_4 is formula_5. The gradient of formula_6 at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector. 
p1103
aVThe gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a dot product. Consider again the example with the hill and suppose that the steepest slope on the hill is 40%. If a road goes directly up the hill, then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40%. If instead, the road goes around the hill at an angle with the uphill direction (the gradient vector), then it will have a shallower slope. For example, if the angle between the road and the uphill direction, projected onto the horizontal plane, is 60°, then the steepest slope along the road will be 20% which is 40% times the cosine of 60°.
p1104
asS'Graph'
p1105
(lp1106
VA graph is a picture designed to express words, particularly the connection between two or more quantities. You can see a graph on the right.
p1107
aVA simple graph usually shows the relationship between two numbers or measurements in the form of a grid. If this is a "rectangular graph", these two measurements will be arranged into two different lines at right angles to one another. One of these lines will be going up (the "vertical" axis). The other one will be going right (the "horizontal" axis). These lines (or "axes", the plural of axis) meet at their ends in the lower left corner of the graph.
p1108
aVBoth of these axes have "tick marks" along their lengths. You can think of each axis as a ruler drawn on paper. So each measurement is indicated by the length of the associated tick mark along the particular axis.
p1109
aVAnother word for graph is chart or diagram. However, a chart or a diagram may not relate one quantity to other quantities. "Flowcharts" and "tree diagrams" are examples of charts or diagrams that are not graphs.

p1111
aVHow to draw a simple graph.
p1112
aVLet's say you wanted to make a graph showing your height as you were growing up. You might show your height in centimeters on the vertical axis and your age in years on the horizontal axis.
p1113
aVFor example, say you were 60 centimeters tall at age 1, 85 centimeters tall at age 2 and 95 centimeters tall at age 3. You would draw an imaginary straight line passing through the 50 centimeters height mark on the vertical axis. Then you would draw a second imaginary line passing through the age of 1 year on the horizontal axis. At the place where the two imaginary lines meet (called their "intersection"), you would then draw a dot. Really, the imaginary lines are usually replaced by "graph paper" (see below). The drawing of this intersection is called ""plotting" the point 50 centimeters for year 1".
p1114
aVYou would then plot 85 centimeters for year 2 and 95 centimeters for year 3. If you had more heights for more years, you would plot years 4, 5 and so forth. When you had enough points on your graph, you could draw a line through each of the plotted points, making your graph a "line graph". For example, the line graph at the upper right shows the unemployment rate (as a percent) on the vertical axis and the year (from 1950 to 2005) on the horizontal axis.
p1115
aVLet's say you wanted a single graph showing both your height and your brother's height. This could be expressed as two sets of plotted points: one for you and one for your brother. You could use different colors to tell your plot from your brother's. Or you might plot the Gross Domestic Product (in billions of dollars) as a second line against the same years on the unemployment graph above. This would show you the relationship between GDP and unemployment.
p1116
aVUses of graphs.
p1117
aVGraphs make information easier to see. This is especially true when two or more sets of numbers are related in some way.
p1118
aVFor example, the unemployment rates graph at the beginning of this article could be expressed in the form of a "table". Like this:
p1119
aVBut a long string of numbers makes it difficult to see the underlying meaning. It is much simpler to understand when the table is expressed in the form of a graph. In particular, it is easier to see the relationships between the two sets of data. For example, by looking at the graph you can see at a glance that unemployment was relatively low in the late sixties but relatively high in the early eighties.
p1120
aVScientists and engineers use graphs so that they can get a better understanding of the broad meaning and importance of their data. Salesmen and businessmen often use graphs to add importance to their points in a sales or business presentation. Graphs with many plotted points may be created on a computer rather than being drawn by hand.
p1121
aVMathematicians use graphs that "plot themselves", without taking measurements. For example, the formula "x = y" says that the value of x will always be equal to the value of y. If you plot this formula as a graph, with x as the horizontal axis and y as the vertical axis, you will get a graph that looks like a straight line angled at precisely 45 degrees. The use of these graphs forms a branch of mathematics called analytic geometry.
p1122
aVGraph paper.
p1123
aVUsually, graphs are created on specially designed paper called "graph paper". This paper has evenly drawn horizontal and vertical lines on it. On the right is an example of a sheet of graph paper.
p1124
aVDifferent types of graphs require different forms of graph paper. What we have been talking about in the article above is the commonest form of graphs and graph paper. It is known as rectangular or Cartesian graphs. However the evenly drawn vertical and horizontal lines on the paper are "not" the graph itself but are part of the "graph paper". The "graph" is the set of plotted points, along with its axes.
p1125
aVThere are various types of graphs (and graph paper) other than Cartesian. These include: bar graphs, pie graphs, polar graphs, scatter graphs, three-dimensional graphs, logarithmic graphs and many others.

asS'Correlation'
p1127
(lp1128
VIn statistics and probability theory, correlation means how closely related two sets of data are.
p1129
aVCorrelation does not always mean that one causes the other. It is very possible that there is a third factor involved.
p1130
aVCorrelation usually has one of two directions. These are positive or negative. If it is positive, then the two sets go up together. If it is negative, then one goes up while the other goes down.
p1131
aVLots of different measurements of correlation are used for different situations. For example on a scatter graph, people draw a line of best fit to show the direction of the correlation. 
p1132
aVExplaining correlation.
p1133
aV"Strong" and "weak" are words used to describe correlation. If there is strong correlation, then the points are all close together. If there is weak correlation, then the points are all spread apart.
p1134
aVThere are ways of making numbers show how strong the correlation is. These measurements are called correlation coefficients. The best known is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. You put in data into a formula and it gives you a number. If the number is 1 or \u22121, then there is strong correlation. If the answer is 0, then there is no correlation. Another kind of correlation coefficient is Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
p1135
aVCorrelation vs causation.
p1136
aVCorrelation does not always mean that one thing causes the other thing (causation], because something else might have caused both. 
p1137
aVFor example, on hot days people buy ice cream, and people also go to the beach where some are eaten by sharks. There is a correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks (they both go up as the temperature goes up in this case). But just because ice cream sales go up does not mean ice cream sales cause (causation) more shark attacks or vice versa.
p1138
aVBecause correlation does not imply causation scientists, economists, etc. will test their theories by creating isolated environments where only one factor is changed (where this is possible). 
p1139
aVHowever, politicians, salesmen, news outlets and others often suggest that a particular correlation implies causation. This may be due to ignorance or a wish to persuade. Thus, a news report may attract attention by saying that people who consume a particular product more often have a particular health problem, implying a causation that could be actually due to something else.

VThe Lorenz attractor (also called Lorenz system) is a system of equations. Edward N. Lorenz formulated the equations as a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection. The equations are ordinary differential equations, called Lorenz equations. They are notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight.

p1145
(lp1146
VIn mathematics, an interval is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end. Numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval, and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval. The beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval. An example of an interval might be from 3.3 to 15. Numbers such as 4, 8, 9.5, 14, and even 14.999 are inside this interval. Numbers such as -4, 2, 3.2, 20, and 15.000001 are not inside this interval.
p1147
aVTo write an interval, write either a square bracket ( [ ) or a parenthesis ( ( ), the beginning number, a comma ( , ), the end number, and either a closing square bracket ( ] ) or a closing parenthesis ( ) ). Examples of intervals are (4, 9.6), [-100, 100], [-30, -4).

aVDifferent kinds of intervals.
p1149
aVIntervals can be separated by how they act at their ends. Intervals can be closed, open, or mixed.
p1150
aVClosed Intervals.
p1151
aVAn interval that is closed also includes the beginning and the end. A closed interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include 3, 5.4, and every number between 3 and 5.4. To write a closed interval, use square brackets ( [ and ] ). An example of an closed interval is 450.
p1152
aVOpen Intervals.
p1153
aVAn interval that is open does not include the beginning or the end. An open interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include every number between 3 and 5.4, but it would not include 3 or 5.4. To write an open interval, use parentheses ( ( and ) ). An example of an open interval is (2, 5).
p1154
aVMixed Intervals.
p1155
aVA mixed interval is open at one end and closed at the other end. This means that the interval may include the beginning but not the end, or it may include the end but not the beginning. The interval [9, 23) would include 9, but it would not include 23.

asVNavier\u2013Stokes equations
p1157
(lp1158
VThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids. The equations are named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. The equations result from applying Newton's second law to fluid motion, with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (in relation to the gradient of velocity), plus a pressure term.
p1159
aVThey are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe, the air's flow around a wing, and motion of stars inside a galaxy. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Together with Maxwell's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.
p1160
aVThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist (existence), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any singularity (or infinity or ) (smoothness). These are called the Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics, and offered a US$1,000,000 prize (approx. \u20ac0.7M or £0.6M as of September 2009) for a solution or a counter-example.
p1161
aVThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity. A solution of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a or of a continuum. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories.

This type of postulate was necessary to make possible some major scientific achievements, but can also be problematic since not self-evident. 
p1178
aVThere are also a few characteristics that all postulates should have.

Conversely, in the limit that "b" approaches infinity ("\u0278" \u2192 0) the spiral tends toward a straight line. The complement of \u0278 is called the "pitch".

p1212
aVSpira mirabilis, Latin for "miraculous spiral", is another name for the logarithmic spiral. While this curve had already been named by other mathematicians, the name "miraculous" or "marvelous" spiral was given to this curve by Jakob Bernoulli, because he was fascinated by one of its unique mathematical properties: the size of the spiral increases, but the shape stays the same with each added curve. Maybe because of this property, the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature, seen in some living beings, such as nautilus shells and sunflower heads. Jakob Bernoulli wanted the shape on his headstone, but, by error, an Archimedean spiral was placed there instead.
p1213
aVNotes.
p1214
aVThe logarithmic spiral can be distinguished from the Archimedean spiral by the fact that the distances between the turnings of a logarithmic spiral increase in geometric progression, while in an Archimedean spiral these distances are constant.
p1215
aVLogarithmic spirals are self-similar in that they are self-congruent under all similarity transformations (scaling them gives the same result as rotating them). Scaling by a factor formula_6 gives the same as the original, without rotation. They are also congruent to their own involutes, evolutes, and the pedal curves based on their centers.
p1216
aVStarting at a point "P" and moving inwards along the spiral, one has to circle the origin infinitely often before reaching it; yet, the total distance covered on this path is finite. This was first realized by Evangelista Torricelli even before calculus had been invented. The total distance covered is "r"/cos(\u03b1), where "r" is the straight-line distance from "P" to the origin.
p1217
aVOne can construct approximate logarithmic spirals with pitch about 17.03239 degrees using Fibonacci numbers or the golden ratio as is explained in those articles. Similarly, the exponential function exactly maps all lines not parallel with the real or imaginary axis in the complex plane, to all logarithmic spirals in the complex plane with centre at 0. (Up to adding integer multiples of 2\u03c0"i" to the lines, the mapping of all lines to all logarithmic spirals is onto.) The pitch angle of the logarithmic spiral is the angle between the line and the imaginary axis.

VThe Riemann sphere is a mathematical model of the extended complex plane. The model is named after Bernhard Riemann. The extended complex plane is the plane of the complex numbers, plus a point at infinity. With this model, this point at infinity is "close" to very large numbers in the same way zero is "close" to very small ones. The extended complex numbers are useful for Complex analysis: It certain cases, the division by zero is "well-behaved", in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity. With this model, it is possible to change certain functions, so that they become continuous, which simplifies calculation.

(lp1226
VInfinity is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written formula_1. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a Latin word, which means "without end". Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop.
p1227
aVInfinity is not really an ordinary number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how "many" there is of something, instead of how "big" something is. For example, there are infinitely many whole numbers (called integers), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes.
p1228
aVThere are two kinds of infinity: potential infinity and actual infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is a more abstract idea. For example, there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down.

aVCounting infinity.
p1232
aVThe number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different cardinal numbers. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the natural numbers. There is a smallest infinite number, "countable infinity". It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the rational numbers. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero; formula_2. It is spoken "aleph null". 
p1233
aVIt was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers. The number of real numbers, that is all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of rational numbers, the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than formula_2 is formula_4.

aVA different "type" of infinity are the ordinal numbers, beginning "first, second, third, ...". The order "first, second, third, ..." and so on to infinity is "different" from the order "ending" "..., third, second, first". The difference is important for mathematical induction. The simple "first, second, third, ... " has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero: formula_6. (Or simply omega formula_7.) The infinite series ending "... third, second, first" is formula_8.

(lp1255
VA direct proof is a way of showing that something is true or false by using logic. This is done by combining known facts. No assumptions are made when doing a direct proof. Lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs.
p1256
aVA statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form "if "p", then "q"." Here, "p" and "q" are facts. To solve a statement like this, every case where "p" is true must be considered.
p1257
aVFor example, this statement can be solved with a direct proof: "if x and y are even integers, then x+y is an even integer." Since x and y are even, then we can say that "x=2m" and "y=2n," where "m" and "n" are integers. (This is a lemma.) We can also say that "m+n" is an integer, because adding two integers gives an integer. (This is another lemma.) Then we can say that "x+y=2m+2n=2(m+n)". Since "m+n" is an integer, we can say "2(m+n)=2k", where "k=m+n". We know that any integer times 2 is an even integer. We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer.

Vn factorial (written n!) is the number we get when we multiply every number from 1 to "n". If "n" is 0, n factorial is 1. "n"! is not defined for negative numbers. However, the related gamma function is defined over the real and complex numbers (but the integers it is defined over are positive).
p1299
aVIt is used to find out how many possible ways there are to arrange n objects.
p1300
aVFor example, if there are 3 letters (A, B, and C), they can be arranged as ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA. That's 6 choices because A can be put in 3 different places, B has 2 choices left after A is placed, and C has only one choice left after A and B have been placed. That is 3×2×1 = 6 choices.
p1301
aVMore generally, if there are three objects, and we want to find out how many different ways there are to arrange (or select them), for the first object, there are 3 choices, for the second object, there are only two choices left as the first object has already been chosen, and finally, for the third object, there is only one position left.
p1302
aVTherefore 3! is equivalent to 3×2×1, or 6.
p1303
aVThis function is a good example of recursion (doing things over and over), as 3! can be written as 3×(2!), which can be written as 3×2×(1!) and finally 3×2×1×(0!). N! can therefore also be defined as N×(N-1)! with 0! = 1.

p1313
(lp1314
VAlgebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics studying zeros of polynomial equations. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.
p1315
aVThe main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.
p1316
aVAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics. The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. At the start, algebraic geometry was about studying systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Algebraic geometry starts at the point where equation solving leaves off: In many cases, finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution: this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
p1317
aVIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.
p1318
aVMuch of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space. The developments in topology, differential and complex geometry occurred much in the same way. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles's proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach.

aVTopology has sometimes been called rubber-sheet geometry, because in topology of 2 dimensions, there is no difference between a circle and a square (a circle made out of a rubber band can be stretched into a square) but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight (you cannot stretch a figure eight into a circle without tearing). The spaces studied in topology are called topological spaces. They vary from familiar manifolds to some very exotic constructions.

aVNatural Origin.
p1386
aVIn many problems, we often divide a large space into smaller areas, for instance, a house is divided into rooms, a nation into states, a type of quantity into numbers, etc. Each of these smaller areas (room, state, number) is next to other small areas (other rooms/states/numbers), and the places where the areas meet are connections. If we write down on paper a list of spaces, and the connections between them, we have written down a description of a space -- a topological space. All topological spaces have the same properties (connections, etc.) and are made of the same structure (a list of smaller areas). This makes it easier to study how spaces behave in general, and to use general algorithms. For instance, to program a robot to navigate a house, we simply give it a list of rooms, the connections between each room (doors, etc.), and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room.

p1389
(lp1390
VClosure describes the case when the results of a mathematical operation are always defined. For example, in ordinary arithmetic, addition has closure. Whenever one adds two numbers, the answer is a number. The same is true of multiplication. Division does not have closure, because division by 0 is not defined. In the natural numbers, subtraction does not have closure, but in the integers subtraction does have closure. Subtraction of two numbers can produce a negative number, which is not a natural number, but it is an integer.
p1391
aVOne can sometimes make closure of a mathematical object by including new elements. The integers are a closure of the natural numbers by including negative numbers. The real numbers are a closure of the rational numbers by including square roots of positive numbers. The complex numbers are a closure of the real numbers by including square roots of negative numbers.
p1392
aVSometimes, if one includes an element to make closure, it makes more changes. For example, if one includes infinity, formula_1, that is closure of division, the laws of addition and subtraction are changed. There is no inversion of addition for formula_2.
p1393
aVOrdinary closure is called finite closure. There is also infinite closure. The definition of a topological space mentions infinite closure. Open spaces have (finite) closure of intersection. Open sets have infinite closure of union. That is, in mathematical notation, if A0, and A1 and ... A"n" ... are open sets, then B and C are open sets:

In the newsgroup sci.math, arguing about 0.999... is a "popular sport". It is also one of the questions in its FAQ.

(lp1443
VThe word "rounding" for a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit form. For example, US$23.74 could be rounded to US$24, or the fraction 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3, or the expression formula_1 as 1.41.
p1444
aVRounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as "about 123,500".
p1445
aVOn the other hand, rounding can introduce some "round-off error" in the result. Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations, especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain "ill-conditioned" cases, then they may make the result meaningless.
p1446
aVAccurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as "the table-maker's dilemma" ("below").
p1447
aVRounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.
p1448
aVTypes of rounding.
p1449
aVTypical rounding problems are:
p1450
aVRounding to a specified increment.
p1451
aVThe most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment \u2014 such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc..
p1452
aVIn general, rounding a number "x" to a multiple of some specified increment "m" entails the following steps:
p1453
aV: formula_2
p1454
aVFor example, rounding "x" = 2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing "y" = "x"/"m" = 2.1784/0.01 = 217.84, then rounding "y" to the integer "q" = 218, and finally computing "z" = "q"×"m" = 218×0.01 = 2.18.
p1455
aVWhen rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits, the increment "m" depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).
p1456
aVThe increment "m" is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system that is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the decimal numeral system (that is, "m" is an integer times a power of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the binary numeral system ("m" is an integer times a power of 2).
p1457
aVThe abstract single-argument "round()" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section. The abstract two-argument "round()" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value "m" = 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.
p1458
aVRounding to integer.
p1459
aVThe most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single-argument "round()" function presented and used in the previous sections.
p1460
aVThere are many ways of rounding a number "y" to an integer "q". The most common ones are
p1461
aVThe first four methods are called directed rounding, as the displacements from the original number "y" to the rounded value "q" are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, +\u221e, or \u2212\u221e).
p1462
aVIf "y" is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If "y" is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if "y" is integer, "q" is just "y". The following table illustrates these rounding methods:
p1463
aVWhere many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000, and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 \u2014 whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.
p1464
aVTie-breaking.
p1465
aVRounding a number "y" to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when "y" is exactly half-way between two integers \u2014 that is, when the fraction part of "y" is exactly 0.5.
p1466
aVRound half up.
p1467
aVThe following tie-breaking rule, called round half up (or round half towards plus infinity), is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values "y" are always rounded up. 
p1468
aVFor example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.
p1469
aVThis is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classes.
p1470
aVIf it were not for the 0.5 fractions, the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down, by the same amount. When rounding a large set of numbers with random fractional parts, these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other, and the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers.
p1471
aVHowever, the "round half up" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded up. This asymmetry introduces a positive bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of "y" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of "q" will be 0.0005 higher than the expected value of "y". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the "round half up" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.
p1472
aVOne reason for rounding up at 0.5 is that only one digit need be examined. When seeing 17.50000..., for example, the first three figures, 17.5, determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18. If the opposite rule were used (round half down), then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 17.5.
p1473
aVRound half down.
p1474
aVOne may also use round half down (or round half towards minus infinity) as opposed to the more common "round half up" (the "round half up" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).
p1475
aVFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.
p1476
aVThe "round half down" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded down. This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of "y" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of "q" will be 0.0005 lower than the expected value of "y". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the "round half down" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.
p1477
aVRound half away from zero.
p1478
aVThe other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the round half away from zero (or round half towards infinity), namely:
p1479
aVFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.
p1480
aVThis method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers, and a negative bias for the negative ones.
p1481
aVIt is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).
p1482
aVRound half towards zero.
p1483
aVOne may also round half towards zero (or round half away from infinity) as opposed to the more common "round half away from zero" (the "round half away from zero" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).
p1484
aVFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.
p1485
aVThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers, and a positive bias for the negative ones.
p1486
aVRound half to even.
p1487
aVA tie-breaking rule that is even less biased is round half to even, namely
p1488
aVThus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, +22.5 becomes +22, \u221222.5 becomes \u221222, and \u221223.5 becomes \u221224.
p1489
aVThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of "y" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.
p1490
aVThis variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called unbiased rounding (ambiguously, and a bit abusively), convergent rounding, statistician's rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, or bankers' rounding. This is widely used in bookkeeping.
p1491
aVThis is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.
p1492
aVRound half to odd.
p1493
aVAnother tie-breaking rule that is very similar to round half to even'", namely
p1494
aVThus, for example, +22.5 becomes +23, +21.5 becomes +21, \u221221.5 becomes \u221221, and \u221222.5 becomes \u221223.
p1495
aVThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of "y" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers (including zero), and a positive bias for the odd ones.
p1496
aVThis variant is almost never used in most computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or \u22120.5 to zero, or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point (with limited ranges for the scaling exponent), so that a non "infinite" number would round to infinite, or that a small "denormal" value would round to a normal non-zero value (these could occur with the "round half to even" mode). Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out of range results when possible.
p1497
aVStochastic rounding.
p1498
aVAnother unbiased tie-breaking method is stochastic rounding:
p1499
aVLike round-half-to-even, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd "q" values. On the other hand, it introduces a random component into the result; performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results. Also, it is open to unconscious bias if humans (rather than computers or devices of chance) are "randomly" deciding in which direction to round.
p1500
aVAlternating tie-breaking.
p1501
aVOne method, more obscure than most, is round half alternatingly.
p1502
aVThis suppresses the random component of the result, if occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts can be effectively numbered. But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence, if the total number of occurrences is odd.
p1503
aVSimple dithering.
p1504
aVIn some contexts, all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory. For example, suppose that "y" is an accurate measurement of an audio signal, which is being rounded to an integer "q" in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs. If "y" changes slowly with time, any of the rounding method above will result in "q" being completely constant for long intervals, separated by sudden jumps of ±1. When the "q" signal is played back, these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise, and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost. 
p1505
aVOne way to avoid this problem is to round each value "y" upwards with probability equal to its fraction, and round it downwards with the complement of that probability. For example, the number 23.17 would be rounded up to 24 with probability 0.17, and down to 23 with probability 1 - 0.17 = 0.83. (This is equivalent to rounding down "y" + "s", where "s" is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.) With this special rounding, known as dithering, the sudden steps get replaced by a less objectionable noise, and even small variations in the original signal will be preserved to some extent. Like the stochastic approach to tie-breaking, dithering has no bias: if all fraction values are equally likely, rounding up by a certain amount is as likely as rounding down by that same amount; and the same is true for the sum of several rounded numbers. On the other hand, dithering introduces a random component in the result, much greater than that of stochastic tie-breaking.
p1506
aVMore precisely, the roundoff error for each dithered number will be a uniformly distributed random variable with mean value of zero, but with a standard deviation formula_11, which is better than the 1/2 standard deviation with the simple predictive methods, but slightly higher than with the simpler stochastic method. However, the sum of "n" rounded numbers will be a random variable with expected error zero, but with standard deviation formula_12 (the total remaining noise) which diverges semi-quadratically and may become easily perceptible, even if the standard deviation of the roundoff error per sample will be formula_13 which slowly converges semi-quadratically to zero. So, this random distribution may still be too high for some applications that are rounding a lot of data.
p1507
aVMultidimensional dithering.
p1508
aVThis variant of the simple dithering method still rounds values with probability equal to its fraction. However, instead of using a random distribution for rounding isolated samples, the roundoff error occurring at each rounded sample is totalled for the next surrounding elements to sample or compute; this accumulated value is then added to the value of these next sampled or computed values to round, so that the modified values will take into account this difference using a predictive model (such as Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering).
p1509
aVThe modified values are then rounded with any one of the above rounding methods, the best ones being with stochastic or dithering methods: in this last case, the sum of "n" rounded numbers will still be a random variable with expected error zero but with an excellent constant standard deviation of formula_14, instead of diverging semi-quadratically when dithering isolated samples; and the overall average roundoff error deviation per rounded sample will be formula_15 that will converge hyperbolically to zero, faster than with the semi-hyperbolic convergence when dithering isolated samples.
p1510
aVIn practice, when rounding large sets of sampled data (such as audio, image and video rendering), the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values (such as rounding towards zero), because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error bias and of its standard deviation. This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing (notably for accurate rescaling and antialiasing operations, where the simple probabilistic dithering of isolated values may still produce perceptible noise, sometimes even worse than the moiré effects occurring with simple non-probabilistic rounding methods applied to isolated samples).
p1511
aVThe effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round: when sampling bidimensional images, including colored images (that add the discrete dimension of color planes), or tridimensional videos (that add a discrete time dimension), or on polyphonic audio data (using time and channel discrete dimensions), it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction, or equally into several orthogonal dimensions, such as vertically vs. horizontally for bidimensional images, or into parallel color channels at the same position and/or timestamp, and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions (according to a perception model). In those cases, several roundoff error accumulators may be used (at least one for each discrete dimension), or a ("n"-1)-dimension vector (or matrix) of accumulators.
p1512
aVIn some of these cases, the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally: for example, when working with colored images, the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension (height, width and optionally time) could be remapped using a perceptive color model, so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation, instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently; and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels (left and right) may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors, in a balanced way around zero.
p1513
aVRounding to simple fractions.
p1514
aVIn some contexts it is desirable to round a given number "x" to a "neat" fraction \u2014 that is, the nearest fraction "z" = "m"/"n"
p1515
aVwhose numerator "m" and denominator "n" do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit "m". This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern-Brocot tree, and continued fractions.
p1516
aVScaled rounding.
p1517
aVThis type of rounding, which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale, is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result. Concretely, the intent is to limit the number of significant digits, rounding the value so that non-significant digits will be dropped. This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating-point values with limited precision (such as IEEE-754 "float" and "double" types), but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base.
p1518
aVFor example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps (for example wave lengths, whose base is not necessarily an integer measure), or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widths (but the most common use is with integer bases such as 10 or 2).
p1519
aVThis type of rounding is based on a logarithmic scale defined by a fixed non-zero real scaling factor "s" (in most frequent cases this factor is "s"=1) and a fixed positive base "b">1 (not necessarily an integer and most often different from the scaling factor), and a fixed integer number "n">0 of significant digits in that base (which will determine the value of the increment to use for rounding, along with the computed effective scale of the rounded number).
p1520
aVThe primary argument number (as well as the resulting rounded number) is first represented in exponential notation "x" = "s"·"a"·"m"·"b""c", such that the sign "s" is either +1 or \u22121, the absolute mantissa "a" is restricted to the half-open positive interval [1/"b",1), and the exponent "c" is any (positive or negative) integer. In that representation, all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero.
p1521
aVIf the source number (or rounded number) is 0, the absolute mantisssa "a" is defined as 0, the exponent "c" is fixed to an arbitrary value (0 in most conventions, but some floating-point representations cannot use a null absolute mantissa but reserve a specific maximum negative value for the exponent "c" to represent the number 0 itself), and the sign "s" may be arbitrarily chosen between \u22121 or +1 (it is generally set to +1 for simple zero, or it is set to the same sign as the argument in the rounded value if the number representation allows to differentiate positive and negative zeroes, even if they finally represent the same numeric value 0).
p1522
aVA scaled exponential representation as "x" = "a"·"s"·"b""c" may also be used equivalently, with a signed mantissa "a" either equal to zero or within one of the two half-open intervals (\u22121,\u22121/"b"] and [+1/"b",+1), and this will be the case in the algorithm below.
p1523
aVThe steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following:
p1524
aVFor the abstract "round()" function, this type of rounding can use any one of the "rounding to integer" modes described more completely in the next section, but it is most frequently the "round to nearest" mode (with tie-breaking rules also described more completely below).
p1525
aVFor example:
p1526
aVRound to available value.
p1527
aVFinished lumber, writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.
p1528
aVMany design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then "round" to some standard size using phrases such as "round down to nearest standard value", "round up to nearest standard value", or "round to nearest standard value".
p1529
aVWhen a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale,
p1530
aVChoosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding.
p1531
aVSuch "rounded" values can be directly calculated.
p1532
aVFloating-point rounding.
p1533
aVIn floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value "x" into a value "z" with a specified number of "significant" digits. In other words, "z" should be a multiple of a number "m" that depends on the magnitude of "z". The number "m" is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point form.
p1534
aVApart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the Scaled rounding section above, but with a constant scaling factor "s"=1, and an integer base "b">1.
p1535
aVFor results where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if "x" is negative), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an overflow for the usual case of "round to even" is always the appropriate infinity.
p1536
aVIn addition, if the rounded result would underflow, i.e. if the exponent would exceed the lowest representable integer value, the effective result may be either zero (possibly signed if the representation can maintain a distinction of signs for zeroes), or the smallest representable positive finite number (or the highest representable negative finite number if "x" is negative), possibly a "denormal" positive or negative number (if the mantissa is storing all its significant digits, in which case the most significant digit may still be stored in a lower position by setting the highest stored digits to zero, and this stored mantissa does not drop the most significant digit, something that is possible when base "b"=2 because the most significant digit is always 1 in that base), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an underflow for the usual case of "round to even" is always the appropriate zero.
p1537
aVDouble rounding.
p1538
aVRounding a number twice in succession to different precisions, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.
p1539
aVSome computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations, the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point.
p1540
aVThe Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a "strictfp" qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.
p1541
aVExact computation with rounded arithmetic.
p1542
aVIt is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range. For example, if we know that an integer "n" is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting "n" to a floating-point value "x", computing the approximate square root "y" of "x" with floating point, and then rounding "y" to the nearest integer "q". If "n" is not too big, the floating-point roundoff error in "y" will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value "q" will be the exact square root of "n". In most modern computers, this method may be much faster than computing the square root of "n" by an all-integer algorithm.
p1543
aVThe table-maker's dilemma.
p1544
aVWilliam Kahan coined the term "The Table-Maker's Dilemma" for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions:
p1545
aV: "Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute y^w correctly rounded for "every" two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary transcendental functions mostly within slightly more than half an ulp and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't Y^W be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it "correctly" to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem."
p1546
aVThe IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. However, no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best.
p1547
aVUsing the Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem and Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time.
p1548
aVThere are some packages around now that offer full accuracy. The MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision.
p1549
aVIt is possible to devise well-defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated. For instance, if Goldbach's conjecture is true but unprovable, then it is impossible to correctly round down 0.5 + 10-n where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0.5 if there is no such number. This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.
p1550
aVHistory.
p1551
aVThe concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60.
p1552
aVRounded approximations to \u03c0, the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient.
p1553
aVThe "Round-to-even" method has served as the ASTM (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms "unbiased rounding" and "statistician's rounding" are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 4th edition of "Probability and Theory of Errors" Robert Simpson Woodward called this "the computer's rule" indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. Churchill Eisenhart's 1947 paper "Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data" (in "Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis", McGrawHill, 1947, Eisenhart, Hastay, and Wallis, editors) indicated that the practice was already "well established" in data analysis.
p1554
aVThe origin of the term "bankers' rounding" remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report "The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts" suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that "half-way" amounts should be rounded up.

aVUntil the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case, specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.

aVRounding functions in programming languages.
p1557
aVMost programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as FORTRAN and C, would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable, or using a fractional number as an index of an array. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.
p1558
aVIn the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up/ceiling, down/floor, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE-754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a double precision float argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits, this approach may avoid spurious overflows in languages have 32-bit integers. Some languages, such as PHP, provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a "printf" or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the "precision"). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.
p1559
aVOn the opposite, CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface-description-language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE-754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard Javascript or ECMAScript interface bindings).

aVIn a guideline issued in mid-1966, the U.S. Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the "round half up" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and \u22121.5 should become \u22121. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was "round half away from zero".

(lp1570
VGödel's incompleteness theorems'" is the name given to two theorems, proved by Kurt Gödel in 1931. They are theorems in mathematical logic.
p1571
aVIn a formal system, there are axioms. All axioms are assumed to be true, at any rate for the purpose of the logic. A theorem then comes up with "other true statements from the axioms", using certain rules. A sequence of such statements is called a "proof" of a statement, because it shows that the statement is true, given the axioms. 
p1572
aVIdeally, it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner. A system that has this property is called "complete"; one that does not is called "incomplete". Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions. This means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time. A system that does not include theories that allow this is called "consistent".
p1573
aVGödel said that "every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent":

aVMost people think this shows that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible. This would give a negative answer to Hilbert's second problem.

p1586
aVSometimes people describe the ways in which people with learning difficulties and autism interact with their own bodies and the environment as behaviour problems because they find it disturbing, but this is controversial. These do not cause hurt and are not meant to cause upset but are seen as self-expression or self-soothing by the adult or child acting in these ways- such as rocking themselves or repeated actions like moving doors and drawers or echoing the movement in the environment, such as the movement of a flag in the wind. The argument is that it is other people's problem if self-expression or self soothing that hurts no-one is something which other people find disturbing. 
p1587
aV"Communication problems" are when people struggle to talk in a way that helps and feels good. Communication problems come from many kinds of problems, body problems such as with the ears, learning and mental problems, being in a new country or an ethnic minority or using special science words. For example a person who is deaf has communication problems because he cannot hear the spoken words most people use, but this is different when he is in an environment where everyone can use sign-language well, or if he can speak and others allow him to lip read. Those with developmental delay or learning disability or learning differences or speaking in a second language may be said to have "communication problems". Problems in relationships in families and between friends are often called "communication problems". People who must work together but use different words, for example science words and simple words, to talk about the same things, they are also said to have communication problems.

aVProportionality constant.
p1621
aVA Proportionality constant is a number that is used to convert a measurement in one system to the equivalent measurement in another system. For instance, people who are familiar with the traditional system of units used in the United States, pounds, feet, inches, etc., may need to find out the metric equivalent for these measures in grams and meters. To make these calculations they would need some proportionality constants.

p1633
aVStarting, perhaps, with G. Udny Yule's paper in 1902, population theorists tackled key issues in genetics and evolution. G.H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg showed that if a population had random mating, no selection, migration or mutation, then the proportion of alleles would remain the same generation after generation. This was the Hardy\u2013Weinberg law, the first great result of this new field of research.
p1634
aVPopulation genetics made great progress from 1918 to 1937. During this period, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright worked on the connection between evolution and genetics, using new mathematical techniques, such as statistical probability. E.B. Ford and Theodosius Dobzhansky did field research on the genetics of natural populations of lepidoptera and "Drosophila", respectively. Broadly speaking, this work proved that the newly rediscovered Mendelian genetics could be reconciled with Darwinian evolution. This laid the groundwork for the modern evolutionary synthesis, which took place in the following years, from about 1937 to 1953.
p1635
aVIn the second half of the 20th century, population geneticists tackled a range of complex evolutionary problems, such as the evolution of sex, sexual selection, kin selection (altruism), mimicry and molecular evolution. The key figures included John Maynard Smith, Motoo Kimura and William Hamilton. Techniques developed for population genetics help to decide what contribution heredity and environment make in developmental biology.

Zeno constructed them to answer those who thought the idea of Parmenides that "all is one and unchanging" was absurd. Three of Zeno's paradoxes are the most famous and most problematic; two are presented below. Although the specifics of each paradox differ from one another, they all deal with the tension between the apparent continuous nature of space and time and the discrete or incremental nature of physics.

aVIn the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 metres, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow). After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 metres, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the slower tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 metres. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that 10 metre distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther. It will then take still more time for Achilles to reach this third point, while the tortoise again moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, because there are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been, he can never overtake the tortoise.

Aristotle (who is the source for much of what we know about Zeno) noted that as the distance (in the dichotomy paradox) decreases, the time to travel each distance gets exceedingly smaller and smaller. Before 212 BCE, Archimedes had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller (such as 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...).

VChaos theory is a part of mathematics. It looks at certain systems that are very sensitive. A very small change may make the system behave completely differently. 
p1730
aVVery small changes in the starting position of a chaotic system make a big difference after a while. This is why even large computers cannot tell the weather for more than a few days in the future. Even if the weather was perfectly measured, a small change or error will make the prediction completely wrong. Since even a butterfly can make enough wind with its wings to do this, a chaotic system is sometimes called the "butterfly effect". No computer knows enough to tell how the small wind will change the weather.
p1731
aVSome systems (like weather) might appear random at first look, but chaos theory says that these kinds of systems or patterns may not be. If people pay close enough attention to what is really going on, they might notice the chaotic patterns.

p1734
aVAs an example, take a pendulum that is attached at some point, and swings freely. Connecting a second pendulum to the first will make the system completely different. It is very hard to start in exactly the same position again - a change in starting position so small that it cannot even be seen can quickly cause the pendulum swing to become different from what it was before.

aVA very important part to the study of chaos theory is the study of mathematics functions that are known as "fractals".

Due to the fact that they are mathematical, they are easy to study.

aVGraham's number comes from a variation on this question.
p1749
aVBy asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of "n" is the answer "no" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of "n" is it "yes" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet.
p1750
aVIn 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for "n"=6, the answer is "no". But when "n" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is "yes".
p1751
aVOne of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually "yes" for at least some large "n". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much.

aVGraham's number is not only too big to write down, it is too big even to express in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation.
p1754
aVWe will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used to define the next. When we get to g64, that will be Graham's number.
p1755
aVFirst, here are some examples of up-arrows:
p1756
aVThe next step like this is formula_8 or formula_9. This is the number we will call g1.
p1757
aVAfter that, g2 is equal to formula_10; the number of arrows in this number is g1.
p1758
aVg3 is equal to formula_11, where the number of arrows is g2.
p1759
aVWe keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_11, where the number of arrows is g63.

VA Spiral is a special curve in mathematics. This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a circle (which is always at the same distance or an ellipse. A spiral is an "open" curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.
p1764
aVTwo-dimensional spirals.
p1765
aVA two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates. There the radius "r" is a continuous monotonic function of angle \u03b8 ("theta"). The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case. With the circle, the function would not be strictly monotonic, but constant.
p1766
aVSome of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:
p1767
aVThree-dimensional spirals.
p1768
aVFor simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, "h" (height), is also a continuous, monotonic function of \u03b8. For example, a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of \u03b8.

aVThe helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three-dimensional spiral.

aVFor a helix with thickness, see spring (math).

aVIn nature.
p1772
aVThe study of spirals in nature have a long history, Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral. Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from "Helix" to "Spirula" and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D\u2019Arcy Wentworth Thompson's "On Growth and Form" gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shell such as "Nautilus" and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern.

aVThompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.

aVThe spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.

p1780
aVThe spiral plays an important role in symbolism. It appears in megalithic art, notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also triple spiral.
p1781
aVScholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun. Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Chang'an (modern-day Xian).
p1782
aVThe spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent. Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the "life-death-rebirth" cycle. Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning. 
p1783
aVSpirals are also a symbol of hypnosis. This most likely comes from the cliché of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being Kaa in Disney's "The Jungle Book"). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral is also a prominent symbol in the anime "Gurren Lagann", where it symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA, representing biological evolution, and the spiral structure of a galaxy, representing universal evolution.

aVOrders of magnitude are generally used to make very approximate comparisons. It is mainly used while doing scientific notation. If two numbers differ by one order of magnitude, one is about ten times larger than the other. If they differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100. Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

aVNewton dealt with series in his works on "Analysis with infinite series" (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), "Method of fluxions and infinite series" (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and "Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum" (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his "Optiks"). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of ("x"+"o")"n" which he then linearizes by "taking limits" (letting "o"\u21920).
p1804
aVIn the 18th century, mathematicians like Euler succeeded in summing some "divergent" series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, Lagrange in his "Théorie des fonctions analytiques" (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. Gauss in his etude of hypergeometric series (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.
p1805
aVThe modern definition of a limit (for any \u03b5 there exists an index "N" so that ...) was given by Bernhard Bolzano ("Der binomische Lehrsatz", Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by Karl Weierstraß in the 1870s.

VMathematics, sometimes shortened to maths (in England, Australia, New Zealand and France) or math (in the United States, Canada and Germany) is the study of numbers, shapes and patterns. Mathematicians are people who learn about and discover such things in mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world, so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics. Today, mathematics is needed in many jobs. Business, science, engineering, and construction need some knowledge of mathematics.
p1815
aVMathematicians solve problems by using logic. Mathematicians often use deduction. Deduction is a special way of thinking to discover and prove new truths using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking.

aVMathematics uses logic, paper, and calculator. These things are used to create general rules, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out information that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics solves many problems at the same time. 
p1819
aVA "proof" gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called "axioms". A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a "theorem". Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it. That idea is called a "conjecture" until they find a proof.
p1820
aVSometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are chosen because they are considered simple or beautiful. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us understand the world better.

(lp1850
VIn mathematics, algebraic varieties (also called varieties) are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry. The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.
p1851
aVConventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ: Some authors require that an ""algebraic variety"" is, by definition, "irreducible" (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets.
p1852
aVThe notion of variety is similar to that of manifold. The difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. 
p1853
aVProven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry.

VSigned Number representations are used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary. The problem of trying to store the negative sign (\u2212) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign.

VBinary adders are devices used to add binary numbers. They are used in computers. They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum. In its most basic form, it uses two XOR gates, two AND gates, and an OR gate. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. 
p1897
aVWhen solving this example 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fifth digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21).

Much like the Babylonian approximation of formula_1, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.
p1941
aVNumerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary differential equations appear in star movement; optimization occurs in portfolio management; numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.
p1942
aVComputers greatly helped this task. Before there were computers, numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations.

VAn abacus is a very old tool used for math. It is still used in some parts of the world. Sometimes blind people will use an abacus, because they can feel the numbers easily. The most common abacuses work by moving beads on rods.
p1946
aVAbacuses can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and people can use them to find the square root of whole numbers. Expert, or very good, abacus users can sometimes do math quicker than basic calculators. There is a common Chinese abacus. This abacus is split into two kinds of basic rows, the top is for the "5"s, and the bottom is for the "ones". There are one or two beads in the top rows, and four or five beads in the bottom ones. For example, 8 is one bead on top and 3 below, because 5 + 3 = 8. Every column represents a different digit. The Abacus is really useful for math and is really fun to mess around with and just have fun with. Good to get for young children as toys or to help them learn.

VMutual information measures how much more is known about one random value when given another. For example, knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is, but it will give some "hint". In the same way, knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature, but will make certain temperatures "more or less likely". These "hints" or "changes in likelihood" are explained and measured with mutual information.

aVCalculating mutual information.
p1969
aVRequired information.
p1970
aVTo calculate mutual information, the probability (chance) of all possible events, and the probability of them happening at the same time, is needed. For example, to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius, how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March.
p1971
aVFormula.
p1972
aVThe formula requires the summation, or adding up, of many terms or numbers. Every possible outcome has its own term. From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature, we will use the following variables:
p1973
aVThis means m(3) equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March. This is 31/365, or about 0.085, since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March.

asS'Relation (mathematics)'
p1994
(lp1995
VIn mathematics, a relation is used to describe certain properties of things. That way, certain things may be connected in some way; this is called a relation. It is clear, that things are either related, or they are not, there are no in-betweens. Relations are classified into four types based on mapping of elements. 
p1996
aVFormally, a relation is a set of n-tuples of equal degree. Thus a binary relation is a set of pairs, a ternary relation a set of triples, and so forth. In the language of set theory, a relation between two sets is a subset of their Cartesian product. 
p1997
aVThe use of the term "relation" is often used as shorthand to refer to binary relations, where the set of all the starting points is called the "domain" and the set of the ending points is the "range". The domain is the x's, and the range is the y's.
p1998
aVDifferent types of relations.
p1999
aVAn example for such a relation might be a function. Functions associate keys with values. The set of all functions is a subset of the set of all relations - a function is a relation where the first value of every tuple is unique through the set.
p2000
aVOther well-known relations are the Equivalence relation and the Order relation. That way, sets of things can be ordered: Take the first element of a set, it is either equal to the element looked for, or there is an order relation that can be used to classify it. That way, the whole set can be classified (compared to some arbitrarily chosen element).
p2001
aVRelations can be transitive. One example of a transitive relation is "smaller-than". If X "is smaller than" Y, and Y is "smaller than" Z, then X "is smaller than" Z
p2002
aVRelations can be symmetric. One example of a symmetric relation is "is equal to". If X "is equal to" Y, Y "is equal to" X.
p2003
aVRelations can be reflexive. One example of a reflexive relation is "is equal to". X "is equal to" X.
p2004
aVEvery subset of AxB is a relation from A to B.

p2013
aVIn the study of transport phenomena (heat transfer, mass transfer and fluid dynamics), flux is defined as flow per unit area, where flow is the movement of some quantity per time. Flux, in this definition, is a vector.

aVElectromagnetism.
p2016
aVIn the field of electromagnetism, flux is usually the integral of a vector quantity over a finite surface. The result of this integration is a scalar quantity. The magnetic flux is thus the integral of the magnetic vector field over a surface, and the electric flux is defined similarly. Using this definition, the flux of the Poynting vector over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface. Confusingly, the Poynting vector is sometimes called the "power flux", which is an example of the first usage of flux, above. It has units of watts per square metre (W/m2).

asS'Arithmetic precision'
p2025
(lp2026
VThe precision of a numeric value describes the number of digits that are used to show that value. In a scientific setting, this would be the "total" number of digits (sometimes called the "significant figures" or "significant digits") or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or decimal places (the number of digits following the decimal point). This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.
p2027
aVIn both cases, the term "precision" can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded. For example, in floating point arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand. In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies).
p2028
aVAs an example, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places. If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision. The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round-to-even method.
p2029
aVNote that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured. For instance, if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of 12.345 kg, it would create "false precision" if the measurement were expressed "12.34500 kg" with 2 extra zeroes ("00") at the end.

p2037
aVAs a mathematical foundation for statistics, probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in statistical mechanics. A great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in quantum mechanics.

aVHistory.
p2039
aVThe mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyse games of chance by Gerolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century, and by Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century (for example the "problem of points"). Although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event, if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted. Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

aVThere are different ways of proving a mathematical theorem.
p2047
aVProof by Induction.
p2048
aVOne type of proof is called proof by induction. This is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers. There are 4 steps in a proof by induction.
p2049
aV1. State that the proof will be by induction, and state which variable will be used in the induction step.
p2050
aV2. Prove that the statement is true for some beginning case.
p2051
aV3. Assume that for some value "n" = "n0" the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement. This is called the induction step.
p2052
aV4. Show that the statement is true for the next value, "n0"+1.
p2053
aVOnce that is shown, then it means that for any value of "n" that is picked, the next one is true. Since it's true for some beginning case (usually "n"=1), then it's true for the next one ("n"=2). And since it's true for 2, it must be true for 3. And since it's true for 3, it must be true for 4, etc. Induction shows that it is always true, precisely because it's true for whatever comes after any given number.
p2054
aVAn example of proof by induction:
p2055
aVProve that for all natural numbers "n", 2(1+2+3+...+"n"-1+"n")="n"("n"+1)
p2056
aVProof: First, the statement can be written "for all natural numbers "n", 2formula_1=n(n+1)
p2057
aVBy induction on n,
p2058
aVFirst, for n=1, 2formula_2=2(1)=1(1+1), so this is true.
p2059
aVNext, assume that for some "n"="n0" the statement is true. That is, 2formula_3 = n0(n0+1)
p2060
aVThen for "n"="n0"+1, 2formula_4
p2061
aVcan be rewritten 2("n0"+1) + 2formula_3
p2062
aVSince 2formula_3 = n0(n0+1),
p2063
aV2"n0"+1 + 2formula_3 = 2(n0+1) + 2n0(n0+1)
p2064
aVSo 2(n0+1) + 2n0(n0+1)= 2(n0+1)(n0 + 2)
p2065
aVProof by Contradiction.
p2066
aVProof by contradiction is a way of proving a mathematical theorem by showing that if the statement is false, there is a problem with the logic of the proof. That is, if one of the results of the theorem is assumed to be false, then the proof does not work.
p2067
aVWhen proving a theorem by way of contradiction, it is important to note that in the beginning of the proof. This is usually abbreviated BWOC. When the contradiction appears in the proof, there is usually an X made with 4 lines instead of 2 placed next to that line.

VIn mathematics, the trigonometric functions are a set of functions which relate angles to the sides of a right triangle. There are many trigonometric functions, the 3 most common being sine, cosine, tangent, followed by cotangent, secant and cosecant. The last three are called reciprocal trigonometric functions because they act as the reciprocals of other functions. Secant and cosecant are rarely used.

aVDefinition.
p2127
aVThe trigonometric functions sometimes are also called circular functions. They are functions of an angle; they are important when studying triangles, among many other applications. Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as ratios of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a unit circle (a circle that has a radius of one).

aVWe use the following names for the sides of the triangle:
p2131
aVAll triangles are taken to exist in Euclidean geometry so that the inside angles of each triangle sum to \u03c0 radians (or 180°); therefore, for a right triangle the two non-right angles are between zero and \u03c0/2 radians. The reader should note that the following definitions, strictly speaking, only define the trigonometric functions for angles in this range. We extend them to the full set of real arguments by using the unit circle, or by requiring certain symmetries and that they be periodic functions.

If there is another thing, it gets the number four. If after this there is another thing, it gets the number five. More things get more numbers. Each thing gets its own number in this way. The last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are.

Then the count of two was changed by one again, and two plus one is three, so the count was three.

VIntroduction.
p2205
aVIn mathematics, an "ordered pair" is a collection of two objects, where one of the objects is first (the "first coordinate" or "left projection"), and the other is second (the "second coordinate" or "right projection"). An ordered pair where the first coordinate is formula_1 and the second coordinate is formula_2 is usually written formula_3 (sometimes it is written formula_4). If formula_1 is different from formula_2, then the ordered pair formula_3 is different from the ordered pair formula_8 - this is why it is called "ordered".

(lp2216
VA sequence is a word which is used in mathematics. In ordinary use it means a series of events, one following another. In maths, a sequence is made up of several things put together, one after the other. The order that the things are in matters: (Blue, Red, Yellow) is a sequence, and (Yellow, Blue, Red) is a sequence, but they are not the same. Sequences made up of numbers are also called progressions.
p2217
aVThere are two kinds of sequences. One kind is finite sequences, which have an end. For example, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a finite sequence. Sequences can also be infinite, which means they keep going and never end. An example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all even numbers, bigger than 0. This sequence never ends: it starts with 2, 4, 6, and so on, and you can always keep on naming even numbers.
p2218
aVIf a sequence is finite, it is easy to say what it is: you can just write down all the things in the sequence. This does not work for an infinite sequence. So another way to write down a sequence is to write a rule for finding the thing in any place you want. The rule should tell us how to get the thing in the "n"-th place, if "n" can be any number. If you know what a function is, this means that a sequence is a kind of function.
p2219
aVFor example, the rule could be that the thing in the "n"-th place is the number 2×"n" (2 times n). This tells us what the whole sequence is, even though it never ends. The first number is 2×1, which is 2. The second number is 2×2, or 4. If we want to know the 100-th number, it's 2×100, or 200. No matter which thing in the sequence we want, the rule can tell us what it is.

VThe decimal is a way of managing numbers that has ten as a starting point, or base. It is sometimes called the base ten or denary numeral system. The word "decimal" is also used instead of the word "period" to point out the dot that is sometimes used to separate the positions of the numbers in this system. Almost everyone uses this nowadays and prefers the convenience of it probably because it shows up most often in calculations in nature and has "one" as another starting point for the system. The number one is usually the easiest to work with in calculations.

aVDecimal notation.
p2243
aVDecimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system, which uses various symbols (called digits) for no more than ten distinct values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to represent any numbers, no matter how large. These digits are often used with a decimal separator which indicates the start of a fractional part, and with one of the sign symbols + (positive) or \u2212 (negative) in front of the numerals to indicate sign. 
p2244
aVThere are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization, the Chinese counting rods system and Hindu-Arabic numeric system. Both required no more than ten symbols. Other numeric systems require more symbols.

asS'Topological space'
p2267
(lp2268
VA topological space is a space studied in topology, the mathematics of the structure of shapes. Roughly, it is a set of things (called points) along with a way to know which things are close together.
p2269
aVMore precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called "open sets". Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points "near" another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as "any" set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.
p2270
aVWe also have the concept of "closed sets", which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.
p2271
aVOpen sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The union of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then "every" set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed.
p2272
aVA set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces.

p2274
(lp2275
VThe commutative property of addition and multiplication tells us that it does not matter which number we add first, or multiply first. We will still get the same answer if we add them backwards. The same thing goes for multiplying backwards.
p2276
aVThe definition of commutative property of addition is, when we substitute any number for "a" and "b", formula_1.
p2277
aVFor example, formula_2, because formula_3 and formula_4 are both formula_5. It doesn't matter whether the formula_6 or the formula_7 comes first. 2+3=3+2 is the same as formula_1, when formula_9 and formula_10.
p2278
aVWe can substitute fractions too. formula_11. Either way, it adds to formula_12.
p2279
aVAnd for good mathematicians, we can substitute irrational numbers as well: formula_13.
p2280
aVSome operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, 6 divided by 3 is 2, but 3 divided by 6 is 1/2. Do not divide backwards. Dividing is not commutative. Subtracting is not commutative either. But in higher mathematics, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying.

VA Complexity class is a concept from theoretical computer science and mathematics: All problems that have the same complexity are in the same complexity class. This means, that for a given input, they need about the same amount of resources, such as compute time, or memory. The most often used models for complexity are time complexity, which measures the time needed to calculate a result, or space complexity, which looks at the amount of memory or storage needed. When talking about complexity classes, a "worst case scenario" is usually assumed.

VA computer algebra system (CAS) is a large computer program that helps people with mathematics and algebra. It changes and moves around (manipulates) mathematical equations and expressions containing numbers and symbols called variables. Variables can stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for, or can be replaced with any value. It always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression, unless it is being transformed, by a transformation algorithm.
p2294
aVA CAS might be used for integration or differentiation (and other calculus transformations), simplification of an expression (making it smaller and/or simpler), optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables, etc. Most have the ability to plot functions and expressions for visualization, which can be helpful and educational too.

aVUsually floating point arithmetic is available to use if desired, because the arithmetic is done by most computer hardware very quickly. The down-side of floating point arithmetic is that it is not always exact, and is mostly useless for rocket science, because of only 14 decimal digits of accuracy (with double precision floats), and because of a growing round-off error with each calculation, sometimes even less digits are accurate. Rational number arithmetic is exact if all numbers are rational. Interval arithmetic can be used to easily calculate the total possible error of an inexact arithmetic system. Complex number arithmetic is generally supported by allowing the imaginary unit (formula_1) in expressions and following all of its algebraic rules.
