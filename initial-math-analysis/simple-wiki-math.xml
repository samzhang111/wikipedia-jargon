      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="833">'''Percent''' means ''out of one hundred''.  It is often shown with the symbol &quot;%&quot;. It is used even if there are not a hundred items.  The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred.  

Percentages are one way of writing numbers; you can also write percentages as fractions or decimals.  

For example, I have a bowl of fruit with three apples and one orange. The percentage of apples is 3 out of 4 = 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%.

There are ways to convert fractions to percentages or decimals to percentages.

== Uses ==
Percentages are useful because people can [[wikt:compare|compare]] things that are not out of the same number.  For example, [[exam]] marks are often percentages, so people can compare them even if there are more [[question]]s on one [[exam paper]] than the other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1238">A '''variable''' is a special type of amount or [[quantity]] with an unknown value. They are often used in programming [[computer]]s or in [[Maths|mathematical]] [[equation]]s.

A number such as 5 or 200 cannot change its value. For example, if a person stands 5 feet away from a building, the ''distance'' variable compared to the building does not change over time. 5 feet is called a ''fixed amount'', which is the opposite of a variable amount.

But if a person walks away from the building, the distance variable compared to the building is increasing. So it does not have the same value and we can not use the same number for it, as the distance might be 1 foot now, but 2 feet a second later. In mathematics, a variable is usually given a letter, such as ''x'' or ''y''.

In some [[equation]]s, variables are used to show numbers that are unknown. Using a type of math called [[algebra]], one can find the value of the variable.

In [[computer science]], a variable does not have to be a number—it may be a string (text) value, or a date, or an amount of money, or even an object such as a picture.

In [[mathematics]] or [[science]] a '''formula''' is a [[rule]] or [[statement]] written in [[algebraic symbols]]. The [[plural]] of formula can be written in two ways: formulae or formulas - the choice is based on personal preference. 

Formulas use letters instead of words. A simple example of a formula is '''y = x'''. Here, if x is, for example, 1, then y = x so y = 1. Possibly the most famous formula is '''e = m × c &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''. [[Albert Einstein]] created this. In it, e is [[energy]], m is [[mass]] and c is the speed of [[light]]. Thus, energy = mass × (multiplied by) the speed of light &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (squared). The multiplication sign is usually left out, giving '''e = mc &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''.

The &lt;i&gt;formula&lt;/i&gt; '''e = mc &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''' is also an [[equation]]. Every equation is a formula, but not every formula is an equation. For instance, the formula x≡y (x &quot;is defined as&quot; y) is not an equation because no &quot;=&quot; sign is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3272">'''Exponentiation''' ('''power''') is an arithmetic operation on [[number]]s. It is repeated [[multiplication]], just as multiplication is repeated [[addition]]. People write exponentiation with upper index. This looks like this: &lt;math&gt;x^y&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes it is not possible. Then people write powers using the &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; sign: &lt;tt&gt;2^3&lt;/tt&gt; means &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt;.

The number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called '''base''', and the number &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is called '''exponent'''. For example, in &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt;, 2 is the base and 3 is the exponent.

To calculate &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; a person must multiply the number 2 by itself 3 times. So &lt;math&gt;2^3=2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;. The result is &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2=8&lt;/math&gt;. The equation could be read out loud in this way: 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8.

Examples:
* &lt;math&gt;5^3=5\cdot{} 5\cdot{} 5=125&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^2=x\cdot{} x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1^x = 1&lt;/math&gt; for every number ''x''

If the exponent is equal to 2, then the power is called '''square''' because the [[area]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]] is calculated using &lt;math&gt;a^2&lt;/math&gt;. So
:&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is the square of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

If the exponent is equal to 3, then the power is called '''cube''' because the [[volume]] of a [[cube]] is calculated using &lt;math&gt;a^3&lt;/math&gt;. So
:&lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt; is the cube of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

If the exponent is equal to -1 then the person must calculate the [[inverse]] of the base. So
:&lt;math&gt;x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
If the exponent is an [[integer]] and is less than 0 then the person must invert the number and calculate the power. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;2^{-3}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\frac{1}{8}&lt;/math&gt;
If the exponent is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; then the result of exponentiation is the [[square root]] of the base. So &lt;math&gt;x^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{x}.&lt;/math&gt;
Example:
:&lt;math&gt;4^{\frac{1}{2}}=\sqrt{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, if the exponent is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; the result is the [[nth root]], so:
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{1}{n}}=\sqrt[n]{a}&lt;/math&gt;
If the exponent is a [[rational number]] &lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{q}&lt;/math&gt;, then the result is the ''q''th root of the base raised to the power of ''p'', so:
:&lt;math&gt;a^{\frac{p}{q}}=\sqrt[q]{a^p}&lt;/math&gt;
The exponent may not even be rational. To raise a base ''a'' to an irrational ''x''th power, we use an [[infinity|infinite]] sequence of [[rational number]]s (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), whose [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] is x:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\lim_{n\to\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt;
like this:
:&lt;math&gt;a^x=\lim_{n\to\infty}a^{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;

There are some rules which help to calculate powers:
* &lt;math&gt;\left(a\cdot b\right)^n = a^n\cdot{}b^n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n},\quad b\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a^r \cdot{} a^s = a^{r+s}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{a^r}{a^s} = a^{r-s},\quad a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n},\quad a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\left(a^r\right)^s = a^{r\cdot s}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a^0 = 1,\quad a\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;: Where the base is greater than 1 and the exponent is 0, the answer is 1. If the base and exponent are both 0, the answer is undefined.

It is possible to calculate exponentiation of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The matrix must be square. For example: &lt;math&gt;I^2=I \cdot I=I&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1117">The '''Chinese postman problem''' is a [[Mathematics|mathematical]] problem of [[Graph theory]]. It is also known as '''route inspection problem'''. Suppose there is a [[mailman]] who needs to deliver [[mail]] to a certain neighbourhood. The mailman is unwilling to walk far, so he wants to find the shortest [[route]] through the neighbourhood, that meets the following criteria:

* It is a closed circuit (it ends at the same point it starts).
* He needs to go through every street at least once.

If the graph travelled has an [[Eulerian path|Eulerian Circuit]], this circuit is the ideal solution.

Alan Goldman of the [[NIST|U.S. National Bureau of Standards]] first coined the name 'Chinese Postman Problem' for this problem, as it was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician [[Mei-Ku Kuan]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/chinesePostman.html | title=&quot;Chinese Postman Problem&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3643">[[File:Pythagorean Proof (3).PNG|thumb|200px|right|The [[Pythagorean theorem]] has at least 370 known proofs.&lt;ref name='Loomis'&gt;For full text of 2nd edition of 1940, see {{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/32/54/86.pdf|author=Elisha Scott Loomis |title=The Pythagorean proposition: its demonstrations analyzed and classified, and bibliography of sources for data of the four kinds of proofs |accessdate=2010-05-04 |work=[[Education Resources Information Center]] |publisher=[[Institute of Education Sciences]] (IES) of the [[U.S. Department of Education]] }} Originally published in 1940 and reprinted in 1968 by National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''theorem''' is a proven idea in [[mathematics]]. Theorems are proved using [[logic]] and other theorems that have already been proved. A theorem that someone must prove so that he/she can prove another theorem is called a [[lemma]]. Theorems are made of two parts, there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] and conclusions. 

Theorems use [[deduction]], in contrast to [[theory|theories]] which are [[Empiricism|empirical]].&lt;ref&gt;However, both theorems and theories are investigations. See {{harvnb|Heath|1897}} Introduction, The terminology of [[Archimedes]], p. clxxxii:&quot;theorem (θεὼρνμα) from θεωρεἳν to investigate&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorems are trivial, they directly follow from the propositions. Other theorems are called &quot;deep&quot;, their proof is long and difficult. Sometimes, such proofs involve other areas of matematics or show connections between different areas.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DeepTheorem.html Deep Theorem], cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; A theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep. An excellent example is [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], among other areas. 

There are other theorems for which a proof is known, but it cannot easily be written down. Among the best examples are the [[four color theorem]] and the [[Kepler conjecture]]. Both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search which is then verified by a computer program. At first, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but it has become more widely accepted in recent years. The mathematician [[Doron Zeilberger]] has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion51.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.&lt;ref&gt;Petkovsek et al. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">An '''axiom''' is something used in [[logic]]. It is a [[statement]] which has no [[proof]]. This means it can not be proved within the discussion of a problem. So inside some discussion, it is thought to be true. There are many reasons why it has no proof. For example,
# The statement might be obvious. This means most people think it is clearly true. An example of an obvious axiom is the [[principle of contradiction]]. It says that a statement and its opposite can not both be true at the same time and in the same place.
# The statement is based on [[physical law]]s and can easily be observed. An example is [[Newton's laws of motion]]. They are easily observed in the physical world.
# The statement is a [[proposition]]. This means we care more about what ''happens'' if the axiom is true. We do not care so much if it is ''actually'' true. The proposition is given at the start of an [[argument]]. This is a more modern definition of an axiom.

Logic can be used to find [[theorem]]s from the axioms. Then those theorems can be used to make more theorems. This is often how math works. Axioms are important because logical arguments start with them.

== Euclid's axioms ==
[[Euclid|Euclid of Alexandria]] was a Greek mathematician. Around the year 300BC, he made a list of axioms:
# Two numbers that are both the same as a third number are the same number.
# If A and B are two numbers that are the same, and C and D are also the same, A+C is the same as B+D.
# If A and B are two numbers that are the same, and C and D are also the same, A-C is the same as B-D.
# Two shapes that fill exactly the same space are the same shape.
# If you divide a number by anything more than 1, the quotient (result) will be less than the original number.

==Similar concepts==
When [[philosopher]]s speak about [[paradigm]]s or [[theologian]]s about [[dogma]]s, they mean similar things to axioms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="784">The '''Hindu–Arabic numeral system''' is a [[numeral system]]. This system has ten basic [[symbol]]s, they are [[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[8 (number)|8]] and [[9 (number)|9]].

The Hindu–Arabic numeral system was first developed by the [[Hindu]]s. Later, It was introduced to the western world by the [[Arab]]s. This system is now commonly used all over the world.

A different set of symbols are used to represent the numerals. There were also different types of numerals throughout the centuries.

The Hindu–Arabic numeral system is one of the only numeral systems that use a place value system.

An '''average''' or '''mean''' is a [[number]] that is typical of a [[group]] of numbers. The average of a group of numbers is often located in between, in the middle of that group of numbers. An average is found from the group of numbers by [[arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/average&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of average is the [[Mean]]. 

== Sport ==

In some sports, such as [[cricket]] and [[baseball]], averages are used to tell how good a player is (such as [[batting average]] or bowling average). Sporting averages have special rules for how to calculate them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">{{Incomplete}}A '''sequence''' is a word which is used in [[mathematics]]. In ordinary use it means a series of events, one following another. In maths, a sequence is made up of several [[wikt:thing|thing]]s put together, one after the other. The order that the things are in matters: (Blue, Red, Yellow) is a sequence, and (Yellow, Blue, Red) is a sequence, but they are not the same. Sequences made up of numbers are also called '''progressions'''.

There are two kinds of sequences. One kind is [[finite]] sequences, which have an end. For example, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a finite sequence. Sequences can also be [[infinite]], which means they keep going and never end. An example of a sequence that is infinite is the sequence of all [[even]] numbers, bigger than 0. This sequence never ends: it starts with 2, 4, 6, and so on, and you can always keep on naming even numbers.

If a sequence is finite, it is easy to say what it is: you can just write down all the things in the sequence. This does not work for an infinite sequence. So another way to write down a sequence is to write a [[rule]] for finding the thing in any place you want. The rule should tell us how to get the thing in the ''n''-th place, if ''n'' can be any number. If you know what a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is, this means that a sequence is a kind of function.

For example, the rule could be that the thing in the ''n''-th place is the number 2×''n'' (2 [[multiplication|times]] n). This tells us what the whole sequence is, even though it never ends. The first number is 2×1, which is 2. The second number is 2×2, or 4. If we want to know the 100-th number, it's 2×100, or 200. No matter which thing in the sequence we want, the rule can tell us what it is.

== Types of Sequences ==

=== Arithmetic Progressions (AP) ===
The difference between a term and the term before it is always a constant.

=== Geometric Progressions (GP) ===
The ratio between a term and the term before it is always constant.

=== Harmonic Progressions (HP) ===
The difference between the inverse of a term and the inverse of the term before it is a constant.

=== Arithmetico-Geometric Progressions (AGP) ===
A sequence which is both a geometric and arithmetic progression.

== Series ==
A series is the sum of all the terms of a sequence[[Category:Mathematics]]</text>

An '''Automaton''' (one automaton, several ''automata'') is a [[concept]] from [[mathematics]]. Sometimes the concept is called ''state machine''. It is like an abstract [[machine]]. 

Such a machine can be given ''input'', which is either rejected, or accepted. It's like a [[vending machine]]. When something is bought, [[coin]]s (or [[money]]) needs to be inserted into the machine. If these are the right coins, they are accepted, and the requested item is dropped so it can be removed. If the coins are wrong, they are rejected.

Internally, the automaton has different ''states'' it can be in. Feeding it input may (or may not) change its state. That way, the automaton goes through all the input, consuming one item (which mathematicians call a [[symbol]]) at a time. When no symbol is left, the automaton is in a certain state. This may be an ''final state''. In this case the input is accepted. Otherwise, the input is rejected.

If the machine has a countable, [[finite]] number of states, it is called ''finite state machine''.  A diagram that shows all the states, and transitions of such a machine is called '''finite state diagram'''.

==Problems==
Like in real life, there are machines that are too complex to understand. The mathematician and computer scientists therefore ask themselves if a certain automaton is ''minimal''. If it is not minimal, there must be another automaton with fewer states that can do the same thing. An example of an automaton is the [[turing machine]].

'''Euler's identity''', sometimes called '''Euler's equation''', is this equation:

&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* 0: [[zero]]
* 1: [[one]]
* &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;: [[Pi (mathematical constant)|pi]]
*: &lt;math&gt;\pi \approx 3.14159&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's Number]]
*: &lt;math&gt;e \approx 2.71828&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,  [[imaginary unit]]

Euler's identity is named after the [[Swiss]] mathematician [[Leonard Euler]]. It is not clear that he did invent it.&lt;ref&gt;Sandifer, C. Edward 2007. ''Euler's greatest hits''. Mathematical Association of America, p. 4. ISBN 978-0-88385-563-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Fame==

*&quot;greatest equation ever&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Physics World in 2004{{cn}}. See also [[Maxwell's equations]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;the most beautiful equation&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]]{{cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical proof using Euler's formula ==
There are many equations named after Euler. One of them is [[Euler's formula]]:

&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Write Euler's formula replacing ''x'' with the value

*&lt;math&gt;x = \pi&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i \sin(\pi)&lt;/math&gt;

From trigonometry

*&lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi) = -1&lt;/math&gt;
and
*&lt;math&gt;\sin(\pi) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} = 0-1&lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

{{wiktionary|argument}}

An '''argument''' is an attempt to persuade someone of something. Reasons are given to accept the conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/ Argument, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.] &quot;In everyday life, we often use the word &quot;argument&quot; to mean a verbal dispute or disagreement. This is not the way this word is usually used in philosophy. However, the two uses are related. Normally, when two people verbally disagree with each other, each person attempts to convince the other that his or her viewpoint is the right one. Unless he or she merely results to name calling or threats, he or she typically presents an argument for his or her position, in the sense described above. In philosophy, arguments are those statements a person makes in the attempt to convince someone of something, or present reasons for accepting a given conclusion&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;Johnson, Ralph H. 2000 ''Manifest rationality: a pragmatic theory of argument''. New Jersey: Erlbaum, 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt; The general structure of an argument in a [[natural language]] is that [[premise]]s ([[proposition]]s or [[statement]]s) support the claim or conclusion.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2nd ed. 1995: &quot;Argument: a sequence of statements such that some of them (the premises) purport to give reason to accept another of them, the conclusion&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/#3  Stanford Enc. Phil., ''Classical Logic'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reason==
An argument is a [[wikt:reason|reason]] to support an opinion. 

There can be a &quot;strong argument&quot; or a &quot;convincing argument&quot; (for example, a good reason for why something should be done). '''Argumentation''' is the [[process]] of conducting an argument.

The [[opposite]] is a &quot;weak argument&quot; or an &quot;unconvincing argument&quot;. An argument can be [[wikt:valid|valid]] or [[wikt:invalid|invalid]] or a [[wikt:combination|combination]] of both.  Some arguments may appear reasonable, but they turn out to be misleading or wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Blakesley, David and Jeffrey L. Hoogeveen. (2007). [http://books.google.com/books?id=Qavqk92uRGYC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=  ''The Thomson Handbook,'' p. 209].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreement==
An argument is also a [[wikt:disagreement|disagreement]] between two people in a [[conversation]]. 

The [[verb]] is '''to argue'''. When people say that someone is &quot;arguing&quot;, it can mean that the person is becoming very annoyed, but it does not have to mean that. &quot;To argue with someone&quot; can also mean that someone is becoming annoyed. Someone who is always arguing with people is '''argumentative'''.

&quot;To argue&quot; may simply mean &quot;to debate&quot;, &quot;to discuss&quot;, usually between people of differing opinions. &quot;The lawyer argued the case&quot; (he gave reasons why he thought the person was guilty or not guilty). Most people get into arguments (become annoyed) at times, but it is much better to try to agree with someone by discussing the arguments (reasons) thoughtfully. Sometimes an argument can be settled by each person making a compromise (an [[wikt:arrangement|arrangement]] in which each side gives up something).

Arguments can escalate (get worse). Then they are [[dispute]]s. Disputes can escalate into [[conflict]]s. Conflicts may escalate into [[violence]]. But arguments can also disappear or get resolved. People can listen, learn, and see the other point of view. They can be helped by [[discussion]], [[mediation]] or [[negotiation]].

== Formal argument ==
In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[computer science]] and related fields, an argument is a [[variable]] or [[value]] that is passed to a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].

A '''problem''' is a situation that is hard to deal with.  The word comes from a Greek word meaning an &quot;obstacle&quot; (something that is in your way).  If someone has a problem, they have to find a way of ''solving'' the problem.  The way to solve it is called a solution.

== Examples ==
&quot;John has locked his car keys inside his car so that he cannot get at them.  John has a problem&quot;.

=== Social examples ===
We can also talk about a child with &quot;behaviour problems&quot;. That would mean they act in ways that hurt and upset other people or themselves or cause too much disruption.

Sometimes people describe the ways in which people with learning difficulties and autism interact with their own bodies and the environment as behaviour problems because they find it disturbing, but this is controversial. These do not cause hurt and are not meant to cause upset but are seen as self-expression or self-soothing by the adult or child acting in these ways- such as rocking themselves or repeated actions like moving doors and drawers or echoing the movement in the environment, such as the movement of a flag in the wind. The argument is that it is other people's problem if self-expression or self soothing that hurts no-one is something which other people find disturbing. 

&quot;Communication problems&quot; are when people struggle to talk in a way that helps and feels good. Communication problems come from many kinds of problems, body problems such as with the ears, learning and mental problems, being in a new country or an ethnic minority or using special science words. For example a person who is deaf has communication problems because he cannot hear the spoken words most people use, but this is different when he is in an environment where everyone can use sign-language well, or if he can speak and others allow him to lip read. Those with developmental delay or learning disability or learning differences or speaking in a second language may be said to have &quot;communication problems&quot;. Problems in relationships in families and between friends are often called &quot;communication problems&quot;. People who must work together but use different words, for example science words and simple words, to talk about the same things, they are also said to have communication problems.

=== Entertainment examples ===
Some problems are made up for fun.  These are like puzzles.  Some of them can be solved with [[logic]], others can be solved by trial and error (this is called ''[[heuristic]]'').

=== Mathematical examples ===
Here is an example of a [[math]]ematical problem:
&quot;John is three times as old as Mary.  In three years time he will be twice as old as Mary.  How old are John and Mary?&quot; (9 and 3)

Children often like to give one another problems that can be solved by &quot;lateral thinking&quot;.  This means using the [[imagination]] rather than strict logic.  Here is an example:

&quot;Peter, Ruth, Samuel and Jessica live in the same house.  Peter and Ruth went out.  When they returned they found Jessica lying dead, surrounded by glass.  They were sure Samuel had done it.  Why did they not call the police?&quot;  The answer is: Samuel was the cat and Jessica was a goldfish.

An well-known example of a problem that cannot be solved is that of [[Squaring the circle]] – how to get a [[Square (geometry)|square]] that has the same [[area]] as a given circle, using [[geometry]]

== Other problems ==
*[[Monty Hall problem]] – a problem about goats and a car in a game show, using [[probability]]

A sphere is not a Euclidean space, but locally the laws of the Euclidean geometry are good approximations. In a small triangle on the face of the earth, the sum of the angles is almost 180°.  A sphere can be represented by several  two dimensional maps, therefore a sphere is a manifold.]]
A '''manifold''' is a concept from [[mathematics]].  Making a manifold is like making a flat map of a sphere (the Earth).

The Earth is a [[sphere]], a three dimensional object of [[geometry]]. Yet, [[map]]s (two-dimensional representations) can be made of the Earth. At the [[edge]]s of a certain map, the map needs to be changed. That way it is possible to make a two dimensional image of the whole [[surface]] of the Earth. There need to be [[rule]]s, on how to change the maps, and some [[area]]s (near the edges of the map) will be on more than one map. It is not possible to make one map only, which would have no edges. This map would either have edges (and overlapping areas), or there would be some places where the paper was torn. 

Each manifold has a [[dimension]]. This is the dimension of the maps, in the example above. It is the same for all maps.

[[File:Double-compound-pendulum.gif|thumb|If these two connected pendulums started in a position that was even a little bit different, the gray line would look completely different.]]

'''Chaos theory''' is a part of [[mathematics]]. It looks at certain [[system]]s that are very sensitive. A very small change may make the system behave completely differently. 

Very small changes in the starting position of a chaotic system make a big difference after a while. This is why even large [[computer]]s cannot tell the weather for more than a few days in the future. Even if the weather was perfectly measured, a small change or error will make the prediction completely wrong. Since even a [[butterfly]] can make enough wind with its wings to do this, a chaotic system is sometimes called the &quot;butterfly effect&quot;. No computer knows enough to tell how the small wind will change the weather.

Some systems (like weather) might appear [[random]] at first look, but chaos theory says that these kinds of systems or patterns may not be. If people pay close enough attention to what is really going on, they might notice the chaotic patterns.

The main idea of chaos theory is that a minor difference at the start of a process can make a major change in it as time progresses. Quantum chaos theory is a new idea in the study of chaos theory. It deals with [[quantum physics]].

==Examples==
As an example, take a [[pendulum]] that is attached at some point, and swings freely. Connecting a second pendulum to the first will make the system completely different. It is very hard to start in exactly the same position again - a change in starting position so small that it cannot even be seen can quickly cause the pendulum swing to become different from what it was before. 

A very important part to the study of chaos theory is the study of mathematics [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] that are known as ''fractals''. [[Fractal]] functions work like chaotic systems: a small change in the starting values can change the value of the function in ways that look random. Due to the fact that they are mathematical, they are easy to study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41602">A '''mathematical constant''' is a [[number]], which has a special meaning for [[wikt:calculate|calculation]]s. For example, the [[constant]] &amp;pi; (pronounced &quot;pie&quot;) means the ratio of the length of a circle's [[circumference]] to its [[diameter]]. This value is always the same for any circle.

In contrast to [[physical constant]]s, mathematical constants do not come from physical measurements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2158">'''Counting''' is something people do to find out how many things there are of any kind. 

==One way to count==
The person counting in English usually starts with the [[number]] one, and gives this number to the first thing. The next thing is given the number two. Then, the next thing is given the number three. If there is another thing, it gets the number four. If after this there is another thing, it gets the number five. More things get more numbers. Each thing gets its own number in this way. The last number given to the last thing counted shows how many things there are.

==Examples==
* For example, to find out the number of hats in a group, a person counts the hats. The person gives a [[number]] to each hat. 

: John has a black hat, a brown hat and a blue hat. Mary asks John, &quot;How many hats do you have?&quot;. John  gives the number 1 to the black hat. John gives the number 2 to the brown hat. John gives the number 3 to the blue hat. Now John has no more hats. The biggest number John gave was three, and each hat has a number. John tells Mary, &quot;I have three hats&quot;. John has counted the hats.

* There are the [[letter]]s A, Q, L, and S on a piece of [[paper]]. How many letters are there on the piece of paper? 

: Tom gives numbers to the letters. The letter A gets the number 1. The letter Q gets the number 2. The letter L gets the number 3. The letter S gets the number 4. There are no more letters to count. There are 4 letters on the piece of paper.

==More counting==
Counting is starting at a [[number]] and changing it up or down a certain number of times. In the examples above, counting started at one and then it changed by one each time something was counted. So at first the count was one. Then the count was changed by one, and one plus one is two, so the count was two. Then the count of two was changed by one again, and two plus one is three, so the count was three.  

Counting can go up or down. Counting can be done on [[fingers]].

==More about counting==
It has been shown that some [[bird]]s are good at counting. [[Crow]]s
are birds that are good at counting.

A '''constant''' is something that does not change. Constants ([[number]]s) are used in [[maths]] and [[programming language|computer programming]].

An important fact to remember in [[calculus]] is that the [[derivative]] of a constant is always [[zero]]. 

f ' (constant) = 0

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1060">In [[mathematics]], '''reciprocals''' are two [[number]]s which [[Multiplication|multiply]] together to make 1. They are also called '''multiplicative inverses''' of each other. For example:

 * 3 and 1/3 are reciprocals because 3 × 1/3 = 1
 * 10/12 and 1 1/5 are reciprocals because 10/12 × 1 1/5 = 1
 * -0.2 and -5 are reciprocals because -0.2 × -5 = 1
 * 1 and -1 are their own reciprocals because 1 × 1 = 1 and -1 × -1 = 1
 * zero does not have a reciprocal because no number times 0 is 1

1 [[division (mathematics)|divided]] by a number gives the reciprocal of that number. For example, 
 
 *the reciprocal of 8 is 1/8 (or 0.125) because 1 divided by 8 is 1/8.
 *the reciprocal of 125 is 1/125 (or 0.008) because 1 divided by 125 is 1/125.
 *the reciprocal of 2498 is 1/2498 because 1 divided by 2498 is 1/2498.
 *the reciprocal of 98 is 1/98 because 1 divided by 98 is 1/98.
 *the reciprocal of 77 is 1/77 because 1 divided by 77 is 1/77.
 *the reciprocal of 345 is 1/345 because 1 divided by 345 is 1/345.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1873">In [[math]], '''imaginary units''', or '''&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;''', are numbers that can be represented by equations but refer to values that could not physically exist in real life. The mathematical definition of an imaginary unit is &lt;math&gt;i = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which has the property &lt;math&gt;i \times i = i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;.

The reason &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; was created was to answer a [[polynomial equation]], &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which normally has no solution as the value of x^2 would have to equal -1. Though the problem is solvable, the square root of -1 could not be represented by a physical quantity of any objects in real life.

== Square root of i ==
It is sometimes assumed that one must create another number to show the square root of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, but that is not needed. The square root of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as: &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{i} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;This can be shown as:

:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\left( \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i) \right)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \left( \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 (1 + i)^2 \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= (\pm 1)^2 \frac{2}{4} (1 + i)(1 + i) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= 1 \times \frac{1}{2} (1 + 2i + i^2) \quad \quad  (i^2 = -1) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{2} (2i) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= i \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

== Powers of i ==
The powers of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; follow a predictable pattern:

:&lt;math&gt;i^{-3} = i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^{-2} = -1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^{-1} = -i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^1 = i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^3 = -i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^4 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^5 = i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^6 = -1&lt;/math&gt;

This can be shown with the following pattern where ''n'' is any integer:

:&lt;math&gt;i^{4n} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^{4n+1} = i&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^{4n+2} = -1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;i^{4n+3} = -i&lt;/math&gt;

'''Logarithms''' or '''logs''' are a part of [[mathematics]]. They are related to [[exponentiation|exponential functions]], and are useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

==History==
Logarithms were first used in [[India]] in the 2nd century BC. The first to use logarithms in modern times was the German mathematician [[Michael Stifel]] (around 1487-1567). In 1544, he wrote down the following [[equation]]s: &lt;math&gt;q^m q^n = q^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{q^m}{q^n}=q^{m-n}&lt;/math&gt; This is the basis for understanding logarithms. For Stifel, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; had to be [[integer|whole number]]s. [[John Napier]] (1550–1617) did not want this restriction, and wanted a range for the exponents.
[[File:John Napier.jpg|thumb|right|John Napier worked on logarithms]]
According to Napier, logarithms express ratios: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;  has the same ratio to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; , as &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;  if the difference of their logarithms matches. Mathematically: &lt;math&gt;\log(a) - \log(b) = \log(c) - \log(d)&lt;/math&gt;. At first, base [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] was used (even though the number had not been named yet). [[Henry Briggs]] proposed to use 10 as a base for logarithms, such logarithms are very useful in [[astronomy]].

== Relationship with exponential functions ==
A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of [[exponentiation]]

Just as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts. The three parts of a logarithm are a base, an argument (also called power) and an answer.

This is an exponential function: 
: &lt;math&gt;2^3= 8\ &lt;/math&gt;
In this function, the base is 2, the power is 3 and the answer is 8.

This exponential function has an inverse, this logarithm:
: &lt;math&gt;\log_2(8) = 3\ &lt;/math&gt;

In this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.

== Uses ==
Logarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easier because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.

Before calculators became cheap and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a [[slide rule]], a tool with logarithms written on it.

*[[Logarithmic spiral]]s are common in nature. Examples include the shell of a [[nautilus]] or the arrangement of seeds on a [[sunflower]].

*In [[chemistry]], the negative of the base-10 logarithm of the [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]] of [[hydronium]] ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the form H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; takes in water) is the measure known as [[pH]]. The activity of hydronium ions in neutral [[water]] is 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; mol/L at 25 °C, hence a pH of 7. (This is a result of the [[equilibrium constant]], the product of the concentration of hydronium ions and hydroxyl ions, in water solutions being 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

*The [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] measures [[earthquake]] intensity on a base-10 logarithmic scale.

*In [[astronomy]], the [[apparent magnitude]] measures the brightness of [[star]]s logarithmically, since the eye also responds logarithmically to brightness.

*[[Interval (music)|Musical intervals]] are measured logarithmically as [[semitone]]s. The interval between two notes in semitones is the base-2&lt;sup&gt;1/12&lt;/sup&gt; logarithm of the frequency ratio (or equivalently, 12 times the base-2 logarithm). Fractional semitones are used for non-equal temperaments. Especially to measure deviations from the equal tempered scale, intervals are also expressed in [[cent (music)|cents]] (hundredths of an equally-tempered [[semitone]]). The interval between two notes in cents is the base-2&lt;sup&gt;1/1200&lt;/sup&gt; logarithm of the frequency ratio (or 1200 times the base-2 logarithm). In [[MIDI]], notes are numbered on the semitone scale (logarithmic absolute nominal pitch with middle C at 60). For microtuning to other tuning systems, a logarithmic scale is defined filling in the ranges between the semitones of the equal tempered scale in a compatible way. This scale corresponds to the note numbers for whole semitones. (see [http://www.midi.org/about-midi/tuning.shtml microtuning in MIDI]).

== Common logarithms ==
Logarithms to base 10 are called common logarithms. They are usually written without the base. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;\log(100) = 2\ &lt;/math&gt;
Some authors prefer the use of natural logarithms as &lt;math&gt;\log(x)&lt;/math&gt; but usually mention this on preface pages.

This means:
: &lt;math&gt;10^2= 100\ &lt;/math&gt;

== Natural logarithms ==
Logarithms to base ''e'' are called natural logarithms. The number [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]].

The natural logarithms can take the symbols &lt;math&gt;\log_e(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ln(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

== Common bases for logarithms ==

|-

|-
|}

== Properties of logarithms ==
Logarithms have many properties. For example:

&lt;!-- --&gt;
===Properties from the definition of a logarithm===
This property is straight from the definition of a logarithm:
:&lt;math&gt;\log_n(n^a) = a&lt;/math&gt; For example
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2(2^3) = 3&lt;/math&gt;, and
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg) = -1&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;!-- --&gt;

The logarithm to base ''b'' of a number ''a'' is the same as the logarithm of ''a'' divided by the logarithm of ''b''. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\log_b(a) = \frac{\log(a)}{\log(b)}&lt;/math&gt;
For example, let ''a'' be 6 and ''b'' be 2. With calculators we can show that this is true or at least very close:
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2(6) = \frac{\log(6)}{\log(2)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\log_2(6) \approx 2.584962&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2.584962 \approx \frac{0.778151}{0.301029} \approx 2.584970&lt;/math&gt;
Our results had a small error, but this was due to the [[rounding]] of numbers.

Since it is hard to picture the natural logarithm, we find that, in terms of a base-ten logarithm:
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(e)} \approx \frac{\log(x)}{0.434294}&lt;/math&gt; Where 0.434294 is an approximation for the logarithm of ''e''.

&lt;!-- --&gt;

===Operations within logarithm arguments===
Logarithms which multiply inside their argument can be changed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)&lt;/math&gt;
For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\log(1000) = \log(10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10) = \log(10) + \log(10) + \log(10) = 1+1+1 = 3&lt;/math&gt;
The same works for dividing but subtraction instead of addition, because it is the ''inverse operation'' of multiplication:
:&lt;math&gt;\log\bigg(\frac{a}{b}\bigg) = \log(a) - \log(b)&lt;/math&gt;
===Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications===
Before electronic computers, logarithms were used every day by scientists. Logarithms helped scientists and engineers in many fields such as [[astronomy]].

Before computers, the ''table of logarithms'' was an important tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Campbell-Kelly | first1=Martin | title=The history of mathematical tables: from Sumer to spreadsheets | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | series=Oxford scholarship online | isbn=978-0-19-850841-0 | year=2003}}, section 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1617, [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] printed the first logarithm table. This was soon after Napier's basic invention. Later, people made tables with better scope and precision. These tables listed the values of log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for any number ''x'' in a certain range, at a certain precision, for a certain base ''b'' (usually {{nowrap begin}}''b'' = 10{{nowrap end}}). For example, Briggs' first table contained the common logarithms of all integers in the range 1–1000, with a precision of 8 digits. As the function {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the inverse function of log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), it has been called the antilogarithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor1-last=Abramowitz|editor1-first=Milton|editor1-link=Milton Abramowitz|editor2-last=Stegun|editor2-first=Irene A.|editor2-link=Irene Stegun|title=[[Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables]]|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-61272-0|edition=10th|year=1972}}, section 4.7., p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; People used these tables to multiply and divide numbers. For example, a user looked up the logarithm in the table for each of two positive numbers. Adding the numbers from the table would give the logarithm of the product. The antilogarithm feature of the table would then find the product based on its logarithm.

For manual calculations that need precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier ways.

Many logarithm tables give logarithms by separately providing the characteristic and [[common logarithm|mantissa]] of ''x'', that is to say, the [[integer part]] and the [[fractional part]] of log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic of {{nowrap|10 · ''x''}} is one plus the characteristic of ''x'', and their significands are the same. This extends the scope of logarithm tables: given a table listing log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') for all integers ''x'' ranging from 1 to 1000, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by
:&lt;math&gt;\log_{10}(3542) = \log_{10}(10\cdot 354.2) = 1 + \log_{10}(354.2) \approx 1 + \log_{10}(354). \, &lt;/math&gt;

Another critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation, as illustrated here:

[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to ''x'' is proportional to the logarithm of ''x''.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]

Numbers are marked on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. Many engineers and scientists used slide rules until the 1970s. Scientists can work faster using a slide rule than using a logarithm table.&lt;ref&gt;Maor, Eli (2009), ''E: The Story of a Number'', Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0-691-14134-3, sections 1, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2197">'''Topology''' is the study of how spaces are organized, how the objects are structured in terms of position. It also studies how spaces are connected. It is divided into ''algebraic topology'', ''differential topology'' and ''geometric topology''.

[[File:Möbius strip.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Möbius strip]], a surface with only one side and one edge; such shapes are an object of study in topology.]]

Topology has sometimes been called rubber-sheet geometry, because in topology of 2 dimensions, there is no difference between a circle and a square (a circle made out of a rubber band can be stretched into a square) but there is a difference between a circle and a figure eight (you cannot stretch a figure eight into a circle without tearing). The spaces studied in topology are called [[topological space]]s. They vary from familiar [[manifold]]s to some very exotic constructions.

== Natural Origin ==

In many problems, we often divide a large space into smaller areas, for instance, a house is divided into rooms, a nation into states, a type of quantity into numbers, etc. Each of these smaller areas (room, state, number) is next to other small areas (other rooms/states/numbers), and the places where the areas meet are connections. If we write down on paper a list of spaces, and the connections between them, we have written down a description of a space -- a topological space. All topological spaces have the same properties (connections, etc.) and are made of the same structure (a list of smaller areas). This makes it easier to study how spaces behave in general, and to use general [[algorithm]]s. For instance, to program a robot to navigate a house, we simply give it a list of rooms, the connections between each room (doors, etc.), and an algorithm that can determine the sequence of rooms to travel through to reach any other desired room.

We can go further by creating subdivisions of subdivisions of space. For instance, a nation divided into states, divided into counties, divided into city boundaries, etc. All this kind of information can be described using topology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1102">The '''theory of computation''' is a [[branch]] of [[mathematics]]. Generally it is seen as belonging to [[computer science]]. The field of study of this subject is to see if a certain problem can be solved by a [[computer]]. If this is the case, then the question is to know if it can be solved in an efficient way. 

There are two major branches in it. The first is [[computability theory]]. It looks to see if a certain problem can be solved by a computer. Since this is a theoretical field of study, no real computers are used. They are replaced by a system called the [[Turing machine]].

Once it is known if such a solution exists, computer scientists want to know if it can be found, and perhaps how it can be improved. This field of study is covered by the [[complexity theory]]. That theory has developed concepts to compare different methods of solving a problem to one another. Such methods are usually called [[algorithm]]s. This is similar to comparing cooking recipes and seeing which of two recipes is easier to do.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="845">In [[mathematics]], a '''binary operation''', often denoted *, on a [[set]] is a way of combining a pair of elements in that set that results in another element of the set. For example, if we take a pair of [[natural number]]s and let the operation * be addition, then their [[sum]] is also a natural number, and is the result of applying this particular binary operation. Another example of an operation on the natural numbers is multiplication. For instance, take the natural numbers 2 and 3. When multiplied together they give 6, another natural number.

Others: The sum between [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The composition of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. The [[Set|union]] and the [[intersection]] of sets are also two different binary operations on the set of all sets, or on subsets in a power set.

A '''proportion''' ([[adjective]]: '''proportionate''') is a [[relationship]] between two [[quantity|quantities]] or [[number]]s. A proportion can be expressed as a word, for example, one man may be described as ''smaller'' than another man. A proportion can usually be expressed more [[wikt:accurate|accurately]] by ''numbers''. For example, the proportion, or [[mathematics|mathematical]] relationship, between one man and two men can be written as the numbers &quot;1/2&quot;, which is also known as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or [[ratio]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5299">The '''Monty Hall problem''' is a famous [[problem]] in [[probability]] (chance). The problem is based on a television game show from the [[United States]], ''[[w:Let's Make a Deal|Let's Make a Deal]]''. It is named for the host of this show, [[Monty Hall]].

In the problem, there are three doors. A [[car]] ([[prize]] of high value) is behind one door and goats ([[booby prize]]s of low value) behind the other two doors. First, the player chooses a door but does not open it. Then the host, who has knowledge of what is behind every door, opens a different door which they are certain has a goat behind it (opening either door with equal chances if the car is behind the player's door). Last, the host lets the player choose whether to keep what is behind the first door or to change choices to the third door (the one the host did not open). The rules of the problem are that the host has to open a door with a goat behind and has to let the player switch. The question is whether changing choices increases the chances of getting the car.

The chances of the car being behind the two doors that are still closed seem equal, so most people say changing choices does not increase the chances of getting the car. The true answer is that changing choices increases the chances of getting the car from 1/3 (one out of three) to 2/3 (two out of three).

That comes from the fact that the player, by choosing one door out of three, has a one chance in three of selecting the door with the car. The chance of the car being somewhere behind the other two doors is two out of three. So to improve their chance of winning a car, the player if given the choice, should swap their '''one''' door for the other '''two doors''' right away. But wait! The host then tries to confuse the player by opening one of their own goat doors. That changes nothing, remember that the player is still swapping their '''one''' door for the other '''two doors''' (even though one of them has been opened).

These are the options:

1. '''(Lose)''': If the player picks the car, then the host will show a goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a goat .&lt;br /&gt;

2. '''(Win)''' : If the player picks a goat, then the host will show the other goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.&lt;br /&gt;

3. '''(Win)''' : If the player picks the other goat, then the host will show the first goat. Then if the player changes their choice, they will get a car.&lt;br /&gt;

So, it is true that if the player changes (switches) then the player will win a car two times out of three.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="925">'''Numerical digits''' are the number [[text]] characters used to show [[numeral]]s. For example, the numeral &quot;56&quot; has two digits: 5 and 6. In the [[Decimal|decimal system]] (which is base 10), each digit is how many of a certain power of 10 are needed to get the value. The rightmost, or units digit,&lt;ref&gt;The units digit is the digit left from the [[Decimal separator|separator]], in case there is a fraction of the numerical base part of the numeral.&lt;/ref&gt; is for 10^0, the next digit is for 10^1, etc.

The numeral &quot;56&quot; means:&amp;nbsp; 6*10^0 + 5*10^1 = 6*1 + 5*10 = 6 + 50.

The ten digits of the decimal system are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Some [[numeral system]]s need more than ten digits. For example, the [[hexadecimal numeral system]] uses 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2102">If two [[number]]s have the same '''order of magnitude''', they are about the same size. 

But if one would compare the surface of an orange with that of the earth, one would say the surface of the earth is many ''orders of magnitude'' larger than that of the orange.

Orders of magnitude are generally used to make very approximate comparisons. It is mainly used while doing scientific notation. If two numbers differ by one order of magnitude, one is about ten times larger than the other.  If they differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100.  Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="425">A '''projection''' in [[geometry]] is something like a [[shadow]], that an object casts onto another object. When a three-dimensional [[sphere]] is projected onto a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], its projection will either be a [[circle]] or an [[ellipse]].

In higher [[mathematics]], projections are changes of one thing into something else. They may also be applications of functions.

A '''logarithmic spiral''', '''equiangular spiral''' or '''growth spiral''' is a special kind of [[spiral]] [[curve]] which often appears in nature. The logarithmic spiral was first described by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and later extensively investigated by [[Jakob Bernoulli]], who called it ''Spira mirabilis'', &quot;the marvelous spiral&quot;.

==Definition==

In [[polar coordinates]] (''r'', θ) the curve can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;r = ae^{b\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{1}{b} \ln(r/a),&lt;/math&gt;

hence the name &quot;[[logarithm]]ic&quot;. In parametric form, the curve is

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = r \cos(t) = ae^{bt} \cos(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = r \sin(t) = ae^{bt} \sin(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[real number]]s ''a'' and ''b''.

The spiral has the property that the angle ɸ between the [[tangent]] and radial line at the point (''r'',θ) is constant.  This property can be expressed in [[differential geometry of curves|differential geometric terms]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\arccos \frac{\langle \mathbf{r}(\theta), \mathbf{r}'(\theta) \rangle}{\|\mathbf{r}(\theta)\|\|\mathbf{r}'(\theta)\|} = \arctan \frac{1}{b} = \phi,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[derivative]] '''r''''(θ) is proportional to the parameter ''b''.  In other words, it controls how &quot;tightly&quot; and in which direction the spiral spirals.  In the extreme case that ''b'' = 0 (''ɸ'' = π/2) the spiral becomes a [[circle]] of radius ''a''.  Conversely, in the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] that ''b'' approaches [[infinity]] (''ɸ'' → 0) the spiral tends toward a straight line.  The [[Complementary angles|complement]] of ɸ is called the ''pitch''.

==''Spira mirabilis'' and Jakob Bernoulli==

'''''Spira mirabilis''''', [[Latin]] for &quot;miraculous spiral&quot;, is another name for the logarithmic spiral. While this [[curve]] had already been named by other mathematicians, the name &quot;miraculous&quot; or &quot;marvelous&quot; spiral was given to this curve by [[Jakob Bernoulli]], because he was fascinated by one of its unique mathematical properties: the size of the [[spiral]] increases, but the shape stays the same with each added curve. Maybe because of this property, the spira mirabilis has evolved in nature, seen in some living beings, such as [[nautilus]] shells and [[sunflower]] heads.  Jakob Bernoulli wanted the shape on his [[headstone]], but, by error, an [[Archimedean spiral]] was placed there instead.

==Notes==

The logarithmic spiral can be distinguished from the Archimedean spiral by the fact that the distances between the turnings of a logarithmic spiral increase in [[geometric progression]], while in an Archimedean spiral these distances are constant.

Logarithmic spirals are self-similar in that they are self-[[congruent]] under all [[similarity transformation]]s (scaling them gives the same result as rotating them). Scaling by a factor &lt;math&gt;b^{2 \pi}&lt;/math&gt; gives the same as the original, without rotation. They are also congruent to their own [[involute]]s, [[evolute]]s, and the [[pedal curve]]s based on their centers.

Starting at a point ''P'' and moving inwards along the spiral, one has to circle the origin infinitely often before reaching it; yet, the total distance covered on this path is finite. This was first realized by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] even before [[calculus]] had been invented. The total distance covered is ''r''/cos(α), where ''r'' is the straight-line distance from ''P'' to the origin.

One can construct approximate logarithmic spirals with pitch about 17.03239 degrees using [[Fibonacci number]]s or the [[golden ratio]] as is explained in those articles. Similarly, the [[exponential function]] exactly maps all lines not parallel with the real or imaginary axis in the complex plane, to all logarithmic spirals in the complex plane with centre at 0. ([[Up to]] adding integer multiples of 2π''i'' to the lines, the mapping of all lines to all logarithmic spirals is [[onto]].) The pitch angle of the logarithmic spiral is the angle between the line and the imaginary axis.

==Logarithmic spirals in nature==

In several natural phenomena one may find curves that are close to being logarithmic spirals. Here follows some examples and reasons:

*The approach of a [[hawk]] to its prey. Their sharpest view is at an angle to their direction of flight; this angle is the same as the spiral's pitch.

*The approach of an insect to a light source. They are used to having the light source at a constant angle to their flight path. Usually the sun is the only light source and flying that way will result in a practically straight line.

*The arms of spiral [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Our own galaxy, the [[Milky Way]], is believed to have four major spiral arms, each of which is roughly a logarithmic spiral with pitch of about 12 degrees, an unusually small pitch angle for a galaxy such as the Milky Way. In general, arms in spiral galaxies have pitch angles ranging from about 10 to 40 degrees.

*The arms of [[tropical cyclones]], such as hurricanes.

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-----
|
[[image:polygon spiral.png]]
|}

*Many [[Biology|biological]] structures including [[spider]] webs and the shells of [[mollusca|mollusks]]. In these cases, the reason is the following: Start with any irregularly shaped two-dimensional figure ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Expand ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by a certain factor to get ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and place ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; next to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, so that two sides touch. Now expand ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by the same factor to get ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and place it next to ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; as before. Repeating this will produce an approximate logarithmic spiral whose pitch is determined by the expansion factor and the angle with which the figures were placed next to each other. This is shown for [[polygon]]al figures in the accompanying graphic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">:''This article is about what computer scientists call an alphabet. There is an article about alphabets (as a writing system) at [[alphabet]]''

In [[computer science]], an '''alphabet''' is a [[finite set|finite]] [[empty set|non-empty]] [[set]]. The [[element|elements]] of an alphabet are called the '''letters''' or '''symbols''' of the alphabet.

An example of an alphabet is &lt;math&gt;\{-,\cdot\}&lt;/math&gt; which may be used for [[Morse code]] or ''{begin, if, else, for, while}'' which may be the [[Keyword|keywords]] of a [[Programming language]].

The set of [[Natural number|natural numbers]] is '''not''' an alphabet because as it is not finite.

The alphabet which is used the most in computer science is ''{0,1}''. It is called the '''binary alphabet''' because it contains two symbols. An alphabet can be used to make a [[String (computer science)|string]] (or '''word'''). This is a finite [[Sequence]] of letters from the alphabet. For example a string of length 5 '''over''' ''{0,1}'' is ''01101''.

The '''empty string''' is the string containing no letters (it is often written as &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;). The empty string is a string over any alphabet.

If we have an alphabet called &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. Then we write the set of ''all'' strings that can be made from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the '''Kleene star''' (or '''Kleene closure''') of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. It is named after the mathematician [[Stephen Cole Kleene]].

The Kleene star of the binary alphabet is &lt;math&gt;\{\lambda, 0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,...\}&lt;/math&gt;. The three dots after '''001,''' show that we cannot write the Kleene star of an alphabet in full because it is an [[infinite set]]. 

Alphabets are important because they are used in studying [[formal language|formal languages]], [[finite automata]] and very difficult questions in [[computer science]] about what can be computed and what can not.

It is written as ''ε'' or ''λ''. The length of this empty string is 0. 

In simple words, given some characters of an alphabet, the empty string is the ''word'' that can be made if no letters are used. There is of course only one such word.

Under [[concatenation]], the empty string is the [[identity element]] of the [[free monoid]] on Σ. That is, for any string ''s'', ''s''ε = ε''s'' = s.

== Representations ==
In many [[programming language]]s, the empty string is written with two [[double quote]]s: ''&quot;&quot;''. The empty string is also sometimes noted by the Greek letter λ.

== Implementation ==
In [[C (programming language)|C]], the empty string is represented by a character array with a [[null character]] in the zeroeth position. Note that all strings in C are terminated by a null character.

This is usually written f(x)=y. The inverse function does the reverse. Let's say g() is the inverse function of f(), then g(y)=x. Or otherwise put, f(g(x))=x.

Not all functions have inverse functions. Finding the inverse of a function can be very difficult to do.

{{enWiktionary}}
In [[vector calculus]],  the '''gradient''' of a [[scalar field]] is a [[vector field]] which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field, and whose [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] is the greatest rate of change.

A generalization of the gradient, for functions which have vectorial values, is the [[Jacobian]]. 

==Interpretations of the gradient==
Consider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, so at each point &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; the temperature is &lt;math&gt;\phi(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;. We will assume that the temperature does not change in time. Then, at each point in the room, the gradient at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly. The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction.

Consider a hill whose height above sea level at a point &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;H(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. The gradient of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest [[slope]] or [[grade (slope)|grade]] at that point. The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector. 

The gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions, rather than just the direction of greatest change, by taking a [[dot product]]. Consider again the example with the hill and suppose that the steepest slope on the hill is 40%. If a road goes directly up the hill, then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40%. If instead, the road goes around the hill at an angle with the uphill direction (the gradient vector), then it will have a shallower slope. For example, if the angle between the road and the uphill direction, projected onto the horizontal plane, is 60°, then the steepest slope along the road will be 20% which is 40% times the [[Trigonometric functions|cosine]] of 60°.

{{dablink|This article is about ''flux'' in science and mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;For other uses, see [[flux (disambiguation)]].}}

'''Flux''' is a term in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]]. It is broadly defined as &quot;How much stuff goes through your thing.&quot;

For instance, imagine a butterfly net. The amount of air passing through the net is the flux.

== Movement of substances ==
In the study of transport phenomena ([[heat]] transfer, [[mass]] transfer and [[fluid dynamics]]), '''flux''' is defined as flow per unit area, where flow is the movement of some quantity per time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R. Byron | last=Bird | authorlink=|coauthors=Stewart, Warren E., and Lightfoot, Edwin N.| year=1960 | title=Transport Phenomena | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-07392-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flux, in this definition, is a [[vector (geometry)|vector]].
 
There are many fluxes used in the study of transport phenomena. Each type of flux has its own distinct unit of measurement along with distinct physical constants. Six of the most common forms of flux from the transport literature are defined as:
#''Momentum flux'', the rate of transfer of [[momentum]] across a unit area (N·s·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). (Newtonian fluid, [[viscosity|viscous flow]])
#''Heat flux'', the rate of [[heat]] flow across a unit area (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Fourier's Law]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carslaw | first=H.S. | coauthors=and Jaeger, J.C. | title=Conduction of Heat in Solids  | edition=Second Edition | year=1959 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853303-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This definition of heat flux fits Maxwell's original definition.&lt;ref name=Maxwell&gt;{{cite book | last=Maxwell | first=James Clerk| authorlink=James Clerk Maxwell | year=1892 | title=Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
#''Chemical flux'', the rate of movement of molecules across a unit area (mol·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Fick's law of diffusion]])
#''Volumetric flux'', the rate of [[volume]] flow across a unit area (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). ([[Darcy's law]])
#''Mass flux'', the rate of [[mass]] flow across a unit area (kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). (Either an alternate form of Fick's law that includes the molecular mass, or an alternate form of Darcy's law that includes the density)
#''Radiative flux'', the amount of energy moving in the form of [[photons]] at a certain distance from the source per [[steradian]] per second (J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Used in astronomy to determining the magnitude and spectral class of a star.  Also acts as a generalization of heat flux, which is equal to the radiative flux when restricted to the infrared spectrum.

== Electromagnetism ==
[[File:Flux diagram.png|right|280px|The flux visualized. The rings show the surface boundaries. The red arrows stand for the flow of charges, fluid particles, subatomic particles, photons, etc. The number of arrows that pass through each ring is the flux.]]

In the field of [[electromagnetism]], flux is usually the [[integral]] of a [[Vector (spatial)|vector]] quantity over a finite surface. The result of this integration is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Lorrain | coauthors=and Corson, Dale | year=1962 | title=Electromagnetic Fields and Waves }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[magnetic flux]] is thus the [[surface integral|integral]] of the magnetic vector field over a surface, and the [[electric flux]] is defined similarly. Using this definition, the flux of the [[Poynting vector]] over a specified surface is the rate at which electromagnetic energy flows through that surface. Confusingly, the Poynting vector is sometimes called the ''power flux'',  which is an example of the first usage of flux, above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Roald K. | last=Wangsness | year=1986 | title=Electromagnetic Fields | edition=2nd ed. | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-81186-6 }} p.357&lt;/ref&gt; It has units of [[watts]] per [[square metre]] (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1301">In [[mathematics]], a '''power series''' (in one variable) is an [[infinite series]] of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n \left( x-c \right)^n = a_0 + a_1 (x-c) + a_2 (x-c)^2 + a_3 (x-c)^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the coefficient of the nth term, ''c'' is a constant, and ''x'' varies around ''c'' (for this reason one sometimes speaks of the series as being ''centered'' at ''c''). This series usually arises as the [[Taylor series]] of some known [[function (mathematics)|function]]; the [[Taylor series]] article contains many examples.

In many situations ''c'' is equal to zero, for instance when considering a [[Maclaurin series]].  
In such cases, the power series takes the simpler form
::&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots.
&lt;/math&gt;
These power series arise primarily in analysis, but also occur in combinatorics (under the name of [[generating function]]s) and in electrical engineering (under the name of the [[Z-transform]]).  The familiar [[decimal notation]] for [[integer]]s can also be viewed as an example of a power series, but with the argument ''x'' fixed at 10.  In [[number theory]], the concept of [[p-adic number]]s is also closely related to that of a power series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">In [[mathematics]], two things are '''equal''' [[if and only if]] they are exactly the same in every way. That is, they have the same (mathematical) value, and the same mathematical properties. Mathematicians use the [[equals sign]] (=) to say this. This [[:wikt:define|defines]] a [[binary relation]], '''equality'''. The statement &quot;''x'' = ''y''&quot; means that ''x'' and ''y'' are equal.

Equivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an [[equivalence relation]] between two sets, that is, the two sets have exactly the same elements. The sets do not need to be [[infinity|finite]] to be equal. A statement that two [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]s denote equal quantities is an [[equation]]. Equations are equal. [[Inequality|Inequalities]] are unequal.

Since a predicate is a way of describing something that is true, another way to say this is that if you can find something that is true about one variable but not true about the other variable, then they are not ''equal'', as far as mathematical logic is concerned.

Here is a simple way of saying that:  if two things are equal, anything that is true about one of them has to be true about the other one. 

In [[geometry]], the word [[congruence]] is often preferred. Numbers are equal, geometrical objects are congruent. Two [[shape]]s are congruent if one can be moved or rotated so that it fits exactly where the other one is.  If you have to shrink or enlarge one of the two objects, they are not congruent. They are called ''similar''

In [[computer science]], usually,  the mathematical definition is used. Very often, the comparison is written ''=='' (and the assignment, i.e. giving a value, is written ''='', or '':=''). In [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] languages, or languages which have [[pointer (Computer Science)|pointer]]s, there is an additional problem. Those languages contain references (which are in fact pointers). If two such references do not reference exactly the same object, they are different. ''a == b'' will be false, for this case.

For this reason, many such languages have introduced another operator (in [[Java programming language|Java]], this [[method (Computer Science)|method]] is called ''equals''). This operator compares the actual values of the objects, not where the variables that reference them point to.

In [[social sciences]], two people are equal if many of the same things are true about them. Two people who have the same amount of education and money and are the same age usually think of each other as equals. Another name for a person who is equal to another person is a [[Peer group|peer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">:''For other senses of this word, see [[identity]].''

In [[mathematics]], the term '''identity''' has several important uses:

*An '''identity''' is an [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] that [[:wikt:remain|remains]] true even if you change all the variables that are used in that equality. 

An [[Equality (mathematics)|equality in mathematical sense]] is only true under more particular conditions. For this, the symbol ≡ is sometimes used. (However, this can lead to misunderstandings since the same symbol can also be used for a [[congruence relation]].)
*In [[algebra]], an '''identity ''' or '''[[identity element]]''' of a set ''S'' with a [[binary operation]] is an element ''e'' which combined with any element ''s'' of ''S'' produces ''s''.
*The '''[[identity function]]''' from a set ''S'' to itself, often denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_S&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x'' in ''S''.
*In [[linear algebra]], the '''[[identity matrix]]''' of size n is the n-by-n [[square matrix]] with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

== Examples ==
===Identity relation===
A common example of the first meaning is the [[trigonometric identity]]
:&lt;math&gt; \sin ^2 \theta +  \cos ^2 \theta = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
which is true for all [[real number|real]] values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (since the real numbers &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are the domain of sin and cos), as opposed to
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = 1,\,&lt;/math&gt;
which is true only for values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in a subset of the domain.

===Identity element===
The concepts of &quot;additive identity&quot; and &quot;multiplicative identity&quot; are central to the [[Peano axioms]].
The number '''0''' is the &quot;additive identity&quot; for integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For the real numbers, for all &lt;math&gt;a\in\Bbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;0 + a = a,\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a + 0 = a,\,&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;0 + 0 = 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, The number '''1''' is the &quot;multiplicative identity&quot; for integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For the real numbers, for all &lt;math&gt;a\in\Bbb{R},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1 \times a = a,\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a \times 1 = a,\,&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;1 \times 1 = 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Identity function ===
A common example of an identity function is the identity [[permutation]], which sends each element of the set &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.

==Comparison==
These meanings are not mutually exclusive; for instance, the identity permutation is the identity element in the set of permutations of &lt;math&gt;\{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}&lt;/math&gt; under [[function composition|composition]].

'''Distance''' is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a [[measure]] of the space between two things.

==Examples of Distance==
* One ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
* John walks [[north]] at 6 [[kilometre]]s per [[hour]] for one hour. John [[walk]]s a distance of 6 kilometres. 
* A [[circle]] is a [[curve]]d [[line]]. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the [[centre]] of the circle.

==Displacement==
Distance is different from [[displacement vector|displacement]]. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. 

==Example of Displacement==
A and B are 1 [[metre]] apart. Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres. Tom's displacement is 0 metres, because Tom started at A and finished at A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1761">{{dablink|For other senses of this word, see [[magnitude]].}}
The '''magnitude''' of a mathematical object is its [[size]]: a property by which it can be larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind.

In [[Mathematics|mathematical]] language one would say: It is an [[ordering]] of the [[class (mathematics)|class]] of objects to which it belongs.

The [[Ancient Greek]]s {{broken wikt link|distinguish|distinguished}} between several types of magnitude, including:
*(positive) [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
*[[line segment]]s (ordered by [[length]])
*Plane figures (ordered by [[area]])
*Solids (ordered by [[volume]])
*[[Angle]]s (ordered by angular magnitude)

They had proven that the first two could not be the same, or even [[isomorphic]] systems of magnitude. They did not consider negative magnitudes to be meaningful, and ''magnitude'' is still chiefly used in contexts in which zero is either the lowest size or less than all possible sizes.   

== Real numbers ==
The magnitude of a real number is usually called the '''[[absolute value]]''' or '''modulus'''. It is written | ''x'' |, and is defined by:

: | ''x'' | = ''x'', if ''x'' ≥ 0
: | ''x'' | = -''x'', if ''x'' &lt; 0

This gives the number's distance from zero on the real [[number line]]. For example, the modulus of -5 is 5.

== Practical math ==

A magnitude is never negative. When comparing magnitudes, it is often helpful to use a [[logarithm]]ic scale. Real-world examples include the [[loudness]] of a [[sound]] ([[decibel]]), the [[brightness]] of a [[star]], or the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] of earthquake intensity.

To put it another way, often it is not meaningful to simply [[addition|add]] and [[subtract]] magnitudes.

A '''fraction''' is a number that shows how many equal parts there are. When we write fractions, we show one number with a line above another number, for example, '''&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''{{Fraction|1|4}}''' or '''1/4'''. The top number tells us how many parts there are, the second number tells us the total number of parts.

==Examples==
#For example, a room where &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; of the people are girls, has 1 girl for every 4 people.
#Think of a cake made of 4 equal parts. Each is 1 part of 4. In maths, you write this as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, and it is called a &quot;quarter&quot;. 2 parts of the cake (i.e. 2 quarters) is written &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, and this is also known as 1/2, half.

== Mathematical fractions ==
A fraction is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] expression relating two quantities or [[number]]s, one [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by the other. The numbers may be [[whole number]]s (or [[integer]]s) – this is a [[rational number]]. For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is a fraction. They can also be [[polynomial]]s – this is a [[rational function]].

Mathematically, a fraction is a [[quotient]] of [[number]]s, representing the number's value when the numerator is divided by the denominator (lower number).  Thus &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; means one divided by two, or, in decimals, 0.5.

To find &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, the denominators are multiplied. That means: denominator 2 multiplied by 2 equals 4 '''or:''' &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; x &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt; '''or:''' 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25.

(In this case “&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; of” means mathematically &quot;[[multiplication]]&quot;.)

To find &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ''divided by'' &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, multiply &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; by the [[reciprocal]] of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is 2. That answer is 1.

The '''Fields Medal''' is a [[prize]] given to two, three, or four [[mathematician|people who study math]] who are not over 40 years of age at each [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Congress]] of the [[International Mathematical Union]], a meeting that takes place every four years. 

The [[Canada|Canadian]] mathematician [[John Charles Fields]] was the first to propose this medal and it was first awarded in [[1936]]. It has been regularly awarded since [[1950]]. Its purpose is to give recognition and support to younger mathematical researchers who have made major contributions. 

== Standing of the award ==

The Fields Medal is viewed, at least in the media, as the top honor a mathematician can receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2006/08/22/math-fields.html|title=Reclusive Russian turns down math world's highest honour|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)|date=2006-08-22|accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes with a monetary award, which in 2006 was [[Canadian dollar|C$]]15,000 ([[United States dollar|US$]]13,400 or [[Euro|€]]10,550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060822/ap_on_re_eu/spain_math_genius_4|title=Russian refuses math's highest honor|last = Woolls|first=Daniel|publisher=Yahoo News|date=2006-08-22|accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions of the award ==
Because of its prestige, the Fields Medal is often described as the &quot;[[Nobel Prize]] of [[mathematics]],&quot;, but the comparison is not so good. First, it is awarded not only to recognize the valuable contributions of a mathematician but also to encourage him or her to continue his work. The Fields Medals have generally been awarded for a mathematician's whole work, rather than for a particular result. 

Another difference is that the Fields Medal is awarded every four years, and its recipients cannot be over the age of 40. Also, the money awarded with the medal is much lower than the US$1.3 million given with each Nobel prize.

A '''logarithmic scale''' is a [[Scale (ratio)|scale of measurement]] that uses the [[logarithm]] of a [[physical quantity]] instead of the quantity itself. On a logarithmic scale, each tick mark on the scale is the previous tick mark ''multiplied'' by some number. 

The logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values – the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range. 

Some of our [[sense]]s operate in a logarithmic fashion (multiplying the actual input strength adds a constant to the perceived signal strength, see: [[Stevens' power law]]). That makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular, our sense of [[hearing]] [[perception|perceives]] equal ''multiples'' of [[frequency|frequencies]] as equal ''differences'' in pitch.

On most logarithmic scales, ''small'' multiples (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to ''small'' (possibly negative) values of the logarithmic measure. 

== Examples ==

Well-known examples of such scales are:

* [[Richter magnitude scale]] and [[Moment magnitude scale]] (MMS) for strength of [[earthquakes]] and [[Motion (physics)|movement]] in the [[earth]].
* [[decibel|bel and decibel]] and [[neper]] for acoustic power (loudness) and electric power;
* [[cent (music)|cent]], [[minor second]], [[major second]], and [[octave]] for the relative pitch of notes in [[music]];
* [[logit]] for [[odds]] in [[statistics]];
* [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]];
* [[Logarithmic timeline]];
* counting [[f-stop]]s for ratios of [[photographic exposure]];
* rating low [[probabilities]] by the number of 'nines' in the decimal expansion of the probability of their not happening: for example, a system which will fail with a probability of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; is 99.999% reliable: &quot;five nines&quot;.
* [[Entropy]] in [[thermodynamics]].
* [[Information]] in [[information theory]].
* Particle Size Distribution curves of soil

Some logarithmic scales were designed such that ''large'' values (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to ''small''  values of the logarithmic measure. Examples of such scales are:

* [[pH]] for acidity;
* [[Apparent magnitude|stellar magnitude scale]] for brightness of [[star]]s;
* [[Krumbein scale]] for [[particle size]] in [[geology]].
* [[Kardashev scale]] for technological advance in [[physics]].
* [[Absorbance]] of light by transparent samples.

==Graphic representation==

A logarithmic scale is also a graphical scale on one or both sides of a graph where a number ''x'' is printed at a distance ''c''·log(''x'')  from the point marked with the number 1. A [[slide rule]] has logarithmic scales, and [[nomogram]]s often employ logarithmic scales. On a logarithmic scale an equal difference in [[order of magnitude]] is represented by an equal distance. The [[geometric mean]] of two numbers is midway between the numbers. 

'''Logarithmic graph paper''', before the advent of computer graphics, was a basic scientific tool. Plots on paper with one log scale can show up [[exponential law]]s, and on log-log paper [[power law]]s, as straight lines (see [[semilog graph]], [[log-log graph]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5371">'''Zeno's Paradoxes''' are a famous set of thought-provoking stories or puzzles. They were created by [[Zeno of Elea]] in the mid-5th century BC. [[Philosopher]]s, [[physicist]]s, and [[mathematician]]s have argued over how to answer the questions raised by Zeno's Paradoxes for 25 centuries. Nine paradoxes have been attributed to him. Zeno constructed them to answer those who thought the idea of [[Parmenides]] that &quot;all is one and unchanging&quot; was absurd. Three of Zeno's paradoxes are the most famous and most problematic; two are presented below. Although the specifics of each paradox differ from one another, they all deal with the tension between the apparent continuous nature of space and time and the discrete or incremental nature of physics.

== Achilles and the tortoise ==
In the paradox of [[Achilles]] and the [[Tortoise]], Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a [[w:Head start (positioning)| head start]] of 100 metres, for example. Suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow). After some [[finite]] time, Achilles will have run 100 metres, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the slower tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 metres. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that 10 metre distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther. It will then take still more time for Achilles to reach this third point, while the tortoise again moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, because there are an [[infinite]] number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been, he can never overtake the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathforum.org/isaac/problems/zeno1.html |title=Math Forum |accessdate=2012-09-12}}, matchforum.org
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web |last=Huggett |first=Nick|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#AchTor |title=Zeno's Paradoxes: 3.2 Achilles and the Tortoise|year=2010 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2012-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dichotomy Paradox==
Suppose someone wishes to get from point ''A'' to point ''B''.  Well, first they must move halfway.  Then, they must go half of the remaining way.  Continuing in this manner, there will always be some small distance remaining, and the goal would never actually be reached. There will always be another number to add in a series such as 1 +1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ....  So, motion from any point ''A'' to any different point ''B'' is seen as an impossibility.

==Commentary==
This then is where Zeno's paradox lies: both pictures of reality cannot be true at the same time. Hence, either:
1. There is something wrong with the way we perceive the continuous nature of time,
2. In reality there is no such thing as a discrete, or incremental, amounts of time, distance, or perhaps anything else for that matter, or
3. There is a third picture of reality that unifies the two pictures--the mathematical one and the common sense or philosophical one--that we do not yet have the tools to fully understand.


== Proposed solutions ==

Few people would bet that the tortoise would win the race against an athlete. But, what is wrong with the argument? 

As one begins adding the terms in the series 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ...., one may notice that the sum gets closer and closer to 1, and will never exceed 1. [[Aristotle]] (who is the source for much of what we know about Zeno) noted that as the distance (in the dichotomy paradox) decreases, the time to travel each distance gets exceedingly smaller and smaller. Before 212 BCE, [[Archimedes]] had developed a method to derive a finite answer for the sum of infinitely many terms that get progressively smaller (such as  1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...).
Modern calculus achieves the same result, using more rigorous methods.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, George B. 1951. ''Calculus and analytic geometry'' Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mathematicians, such as [[w:Carl Boyer]], hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern [[calculus]] provides a mathematical solution.&lt;ref name=boyer&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyer |first=Carl |title=The history of the calculus and its conceptual development |url=http://books.google.com/?id=w3xKLt_da2UC&amp;dq=zeno+calculus&amp;q=zeno#v=snippet&amp;q=zeno |year=1959 |publisher=Dover Publications |page=295 | quote=If the paradoxes are thus stated in the precise mathematical terminology of continuous variables (...) the seeming contradictions resolve themselves. |isbn=978-0-486-60509-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Zeno's questions remain problematic if one approaches an infinite series of steps, one step at a time. This is known as a [[w:Supertask|supertask]]. Calculus does not actually involve adding numbers one at a time.  Instead, it determines the value (called a ''[[w:limit|limit]]'') that the addition is approaching.

In some non-technical [[context]]s or in [[jargon]], ''parameter'' may simply be a synonym for [[:wikt:criterion|criterion]].

In [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], and the mathematical [[science]]s, '''parameters''' ([[Latin|L:]] ''auxiliary measure'') are quantities that define certain relatively constant characteristics of systems or [[mathematical function|function]]s.  

Most commonly represented &amp;theta; in general form, other symbols carry standard, specific meanings.  When evaluating the function over a [[domain]] or determining the response of the system over a period of time, the [[independent variable]]s are modulated, while the parameters are held constant.  The function or system may then be reevaluated or reprocessed with different parameters, to give a function or system with different behavior.  

Loosely speaking, the term '''parameter''' is used for an argument which is intermediate in status between a [[variable]] and a [[constant]].

==Example==

* In a section on frequently misused words in his book ''The Writer's Art'', ''James J. Kilpatrick'' quoted a letter from a correspondent, giving examples to illustrate the correct use of the word ''parameter'':

{{cquote|W.M. Woods...a mathematician...writes... &quot;...a variable is one of the many things a ''parameter'' is not.&quot; ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.}}
{{cquote|[Kilpatrick quoting Woods] &quot;Now...the engineers...change the lever arms of the linkage...the speed of the car...will still depend on the pedal position...''but in a...different manner''.  You have changed a parameter&quot;}}

* If asked to imagine the graph of the relationship &lt;math&gt;y= a x^2&lt;/math&gt;, one typically visualizes a range of values of ''x'', but only one value of ''a''. Of course a different value of ''a'' can be used, generating a different graphical appearance. The ''a'' can therefore be considered to be a parameter: less variable than the variable ''x'', but less constant than the constant ''2''.

* Suppose you want to buy a bike, and that you believe that the amount of money you are going to make next month is defined by the wage you receive per hour times the amount of hours you are going to work (''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ax'')(Income=wage x hours that you work). You are able to influence the amount of hours you work next month (your boss is very flexible), but you think that you will not be able to change the height of your wage (your boss is a real pain when it comes to discussing wages). Then:
**Your wage is the parameter
**The amount of hours you work is the variable.
**This is of course depending on whether you think you can or cannot change your wage.

Suppose that you and a friend are both working for the same boss making the same money working the same hours, that the formula would become:
*(''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''2ax'')(Income=2 x wage x hours that you work).
**the constant is 2
**the parameter is your wage
**the variable is the amount of hours you are going to work

===Engineering===
In [[engineering]] (especially involving data acquisition) the term ''parameter'' sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. For example an airliner [[flight data recorder]] may record 88 different items, each termed a parameter. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term ''channel'' refers to an individual measured item, with ''parameter'' referring to the setup information about that channel.

&quot;Speaking generally, '''properties''' are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; '''parameters''' are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal.&quot; John D. Trimmer, 1950, Response of Physical Systems (New York: Wiley), p. 13.

The term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences. The data that one [[computer program]] gives to another are sometimes called parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2872">'''Probability theory''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with analysis of random phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9375936 Probability theory, Encyclopaedia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; The central objects of probability theory are [[random variable]]s, [[stochastic process]]es, and [[event (probability theory)|events]]: mathematical abstractions of [[determinism|non-deterministic]] events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or happen over time in an apparently random fashion. 

As a mathematical foundation for [[statistics]], probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in [[statistical mechanics]]. A great discovery of twentieth century [[physics]] was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in [[quantum mechanics]].

== History ==
The mathematical theory of [[probability]] has its roots in attempts to analyse [[game of chance|games of chance]] by [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in the sixteenth century, and by [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] in the seventeenth century (for example the &quot;[[problem of points]]&quot;). Although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event, if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted. Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the [[law of large numbers]] and the [[central limit theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">The '''fundamental theorem of [[algebra]]''' is a proven fact about [[polynomial]]s, sums of multiples of integer powers of one [[variable]]. It is based on [[mathematical analysis]], the study of [[real number]]s and [[Limit (mathematics)|limits]]. It was first proven by [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. It says that for any [[polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with the degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the polynomial equation &lt;math&gt;f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; must have at least one [[polynomial root|root]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and not more than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; roots altogether.

Some remarks: 
* the [[degree (mathematics)|degree]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of a polynomial is the highest power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that occurs in it 
* some of the roots may be [[complex number]]s
* it is possible to 'count' a root &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; twice, if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is still a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;g(x) = f(x)/(x-r)&lt;/math&gt;; if you will 'count' the roots in this way, then the polynomial &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; with degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has ''exactly'' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; roots 
* it is not a theorem of pure algebra. It is not possible to prove this theorem without an element of analysis. This element has been reduced to the observation that, firstly, for polynomial functions &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; of odd degree the pair of values &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(-x)&lt;/math&gt; has opposite positive and negative signs when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is large enough. And secondly, that any polynomial function &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; on the real line that takes positive and negative values for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; has to cross &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis.

In [[logic|mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], '''lambda calculus''', also '''λ-calculus''', is a [[formal system]]. It was designed to investigate the definition of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], and how to apply them. It is also a tool for analysing [[recursion]]. It was introduced by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] in the [[1930s]]. Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]].  Lambda calculus can be used to define what a [[computable function]] is. No general [[algorithm]] can answer the question of whether two lambda calculus expressions are equivalent.  This was the first question, even before the [[halting problem]], for which [[decision problem|undecidability]] could be proved. Lambda calculus has greatly influenced [[functional programming|functional programming languages]],  such as [[LISP]], [[ML (programming language)|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

Lambda calculus can be called the smallest universal [[programming language]]. It consists of a single transformation rule (variable substitution) and a single function definition scheme. Lambda calculus is universal in the sense that any computable function can be expressed and evaluated using this formalism. It is thus the same as the [[Turing machine]] formalism. However, lambda calculus emphasizes the use of transformation rules. It does not care about the actual machine that implements them.  It is an approach more related to [[software]] than to [[hardware]].

      <comment>/* Correlation vs causation */ fewer words make simpler</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">In [[statistics]] and [[probability theory]], '''correlation''' means how closely related two [[set]]s of [[Information|data]] are.

Correlation does not always mean that one causes the other. It is very possible that there is a third factor involved.

Correlation usually has one of two directions. These are positive or negative. If it is positive, then the two sets go up together. If it is negative, then one goes up while the other goes down.

Lots of different measurements of correlation are used for different situations. For example on a [[scatter graph]], people draw a [[line of best fit]] to show the direction of the correlation. [[File:Positive correltion lobf.JPG|thumb|This scatter graph has positive correlation. You can tell because the ''trend'' is up and right. The red line is a [[line of best fit]].]]

== Explaining correlation ==
''Strong'' and ''weak'' are words used to describe correlation. If there is strong correlation, then the points are all close together. If there is weak correlation, then the points are all spread apart.
There are ways of making numbers show how strong the correlation is. These measurements are called '''correlation coefficients'''. The best known is the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Even though it is called 'Pearson', it was first made by [[Francis Galton]].&lt;/ref&gt; You put in data into a formula and it gives you a number. If the number is 1 or −1, then there is strong correlation. If the answer is 0, then there is no correlation. Another kind of correlation coefficient is [[Spearman's rank correlation coefficient]].

== Correlation vs causation ==
Correlation does not always mean that one thing causes the other thing (causation], because something else might have caused both. 
For example, on hot days people buy ice cream, and people also go to the beach where some are eaten by sharks. There is a correlation between ice cream sales and shark attacks (they both go up as the temperature goes up in this case). But just because ice cream sales go up does not mean ice cream sales cause (causation) more shark attacks or vice versa.

Because correlation does not imply causation scientists, economists, etc. will test their theories by creating isolated environments where only one factor is changed (where this is possible). 
However, politicians, salesmen, news outlets and others often suggest that a particular correlation implies causation. This may be due to ignorance or a wish to persuade. Thus, a news report may attract attention by saying that people who consume a particular product more often have a particular health problem, implying a causation that could be actually due to something else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6985">The '''decimal''' is a [[numeral system|way of managing numbers]] that has [[10 (number)|ten]] as a starting point, or [[Base (mathematics)|base]]. It is sometimes called the '''base ten''' or '''denary''' numeral system. The word &quot;decimal&quot; is also used instead of the word &quot;period&quot; to point out the dot that is sometimes used to separate the positions of the numbers in this [[system]]. Almost everyone uses this nowadays and prefers the convenience of it probably because it shows up most often in [[wikt:calculation|calculations]] in nature and has &quot;one&quot; as another starting point for the system. The number [[one]] is usually the easiest to work with in calculations.

== Decimal notation ==
Decimal notation is the writing of [[number]]s in the base-ten [[numeral system]], which uses various symbols (called [[numerical digit|digits]]) for no more than ten distinct values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to represent any numbers, no matter how large. These digits are often used with a [[decimal separator]] which indicates the start of a fractional part, and with one of the sign symbols + (positive) or − (negative) in front of the numerals to indicate sign. 

There are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization, the [[Counting rods|Chinese counting rods]] system and Hindu-Arabic numeric system. Both required no more than ten symbols. Other numeric systems require more symbols.

=== Other rational numbers ===
Any [[rational number]] can be expressed as a unique decimal expansion ending with [[recurring decimal]]s. 

Ten is the product of the first and third [[prime number]]s, is one greater than the square of the second prime number, and is one less than the fifth prime number. This leads to plenty of simple decimal fractions:

:1/2 = 0.5
:1/3 = 0.333333 ... (with 3 repeating forever, also called recurring)
:1/4 = 0.25
:1/5 = 0.2
:1/6 = 0.166666 ... (with 6 recurring)
:1/7 = 0.142857 ... (with 142857 recurring)
:1/8 = 0.125
:1/9 = 0.111111 ... (with 1 recurring)
:1/10 = 0.1
:1/11 = 0.090909 ... (with 09 recurring)
:1/12 = 0.083333 ... (with 3 recurring)
:1/81 = 0.012345679012 ... (with 012345679 recurring)

== History ==
There follows a chronological list of recorded decimal writers.
=== Decimal writers ===
* ''c.'' 3500–2500 BC [[Elamite Empire|Elamites]] of [[Iran]] possibly used early forms of decimal system. [http://www.chn.ir/english/eshownews.asp?no=1622] [http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P183.PDF]
* ''c.'' 2900 BC [[Egypt]]ian hieroglyphs show counting in powers of 10 (1 million + 400,000 goats, ''etc.'') – see Ifrah, below
* ''c.'' 2600 BC [[Indus Valley Civilization]], earliest known physical use of decimal [[fractions]] in ancient weight system: 1/20, 1/10, 1/5, 1/2. See [[Ancient Indus Valley weights and measures]]
* ''c.'' 1400 BC [[History of China|Chinese]] writers show familiarity with the concept: for example, 547 is written 'Five hundred plus four decades plus seven of days' in some manuscripts
* ''c.'' 1200 BC In [[History of India|ancient India]], the [[Vedas|Vedic]] text ''[[Yajur-Veda]]'' states the [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 10, up to 10&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''c.'' 400 BC [[Pingala]] – develops the binary number system for Sanskrit prosody, with a clear mapping to the base-10 decimal system
* ''c.'' 250 BC [[Archimedes]] writes the ''[[Sand Reckoner]]'', which takes decimal calculation up to &lt;math&gt;10^{8 \times 10^{16}}&lt;/math&gt;
* ''c.'' 100–200 The ''[[Indian mathematics#Satkhandagama|Satkhandagama]]'' written in [[India]] – earliest use of decimal logarithms
* ''c.'' 476–550 [[Aryabhata]] – uses an alphabetic cipher system for numbers that used zero
* ''c.'' 598–670 [[Brahmagupta]] – explains the [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] (modern number system) which uses decimal [[integer]]s, [[negative number|negative]] integers, and [[0 (number)|zero]]
* ''c.'' 780–850 [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī]] – first to expound on [[algorism]] outside [[India]]
* ''c.'' 920–980 [[Al-Uqlidisi|Abu'l Hasan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim Al-Uqlidisi]] – earliest known direct mathematical treatment of decimal fractions.
* ''c.'' 1300–1500 The [[Kerala School]] in [[South India]] – decimal [[floating point]] numbers
* 1548/49–1620 [[Simon Stevin#Decimal fractions|Simon Stevin]] – author of ''De Thiende'' ('the tenth')
*1561–1613 [[Bartholemaeus Pitiscus]] – (possibly) decimal point notation.
* 1550–1617 [[John Napier]] – use of decimal logarithms as a computational tool
*1925 [[Louis Charles Karpinski]] – classic book ''The History of Arithmetic'' (Rand McNally &amp; Company)
*1959 [[Werner Buchholz]] ''Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary representation)'' (Communications of the ACM, Vol. 2 #12, pp3–11)
*1974 [[Hermann Schmid]] ''Decimal Computation'' (ISBN 0-471-76180-X)
*2000 [[Georges Ifrah]] ''The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer'' (ISBN 0-471-39340-1).

== Natural languages ==
A straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', is found in [[Chinese language]]s except [[Wu (linguistics)|Wu]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities. [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for teens and decades. 

Incan languages such as [[Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten with one'' and 23 as ''two-ten with three''.

Some psychologists suggest irregularities of numerals in a language may hinder children's counting ability {{harv|Azar|1999}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="458">The '''decimal separator''' is a [[symbol]] used to mark the [[border]] between the [[integer|integral]] and the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]al parts of a [[decimal]] [[numeral]]. As this symbol can be a period &quot;.&quot; or a comma &quot;,&quot;, '''decimal point''' and '''decimal comma''' are common names for the decimal separator.  For example 9.5 means nine and one half in [[English language|English]] speaking countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1270">[[Image:Circle-trig6.svg|right|frame|The Unit Circle can be used to model every [[Trigonometric function]].]]
In [[mathematics]], a unit circle is a [[circle]] with a [[radius]] of 1. The [[equation]] of the unit circle is &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The unit circle is centered at the Origin, or coordinates (0,0). It is often used in [[Trigonometry]].

==Trigonometric functions in the unit circle==
In a unit circle, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the angle desired, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\cos (t) = x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin (t) = y&lt;/math&gt;. Using the function of the unit circle, &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, another equation for the unit circle is found, &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. When working with trigonometric functions, it is mainly useful to use angles with measures between 0 and &lt;math&gt;\pi\over 2&lt;/math&gt; radians, or 0 through 90 degrees. It is possible to have higher angles than that, however. Using the unit circle, two identities can be found: &lt;math&gt;\cos (t)  = \cos (2 \cdot \pi k + t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;sin (t) = \sin (2 \cdot \pi k + t)&lt;/math&gt; for any [[integer]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3350">'''Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[paradox]] named after the [[Germany|German]] mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. Hilbert used it as an example to show how [[infinity]] does not act in the same way as regular [[numbers]] do.
Normal [[hotel]]s have a set number of rooms. This number is [[finite]]. Once every room has been assigned to a guest, any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served - in other words, the hotel is fully booked. Now suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. As a convenience, the rooms have numbers, the first room has the number 1, the second has number 2, and so on. If all the rooms are filled, it might appear that no more guests can be taken in, as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms. This is wrong, though. A room can be provided for another guest. This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. In the general case, the guest in room ''n'' will be moved to room ''n+1''. After all guests have moved, room 1 is empty, and the new guest now has a room to occupy. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.

==In case of infinitely new guests==

Another thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside, again when all the rooms are already full. This is done by asking each guest to [[multiply]] their room number by two and move to that room. (If their previous room number was ''n'', this time they would move to room number ''2n''.) This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, the guest in room 4 to room 8, and so on. After finishing, we find that all the rooms with the [[odd number]]s are empty. Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms. Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger.

==If infinite groups of infinite guests come==

The guest at room 11 would move to room 101.
The second person of group 5 (Address 5-2) would go to room 25.

This is not really a [[paradox]], it is only counterintuitive. In a normal hotel, with a finite number of rooms, the number of ''odd-numbered'' rooms, is smaller than the total number of rooms. In Hilbert's Hotel this does not seem to be the case. 

==In case of infinite vehicles of infinite groups of infinite guests==

The guest 1 of group 2 of vehicle 1 (1-2-1) goes to room 121.

==Further layers of infinity==

===Infinite aircraft carriers of the same infinite vehicles===

Address 4-7-7-4 goes to room 4774.

===Infinite spacecraft of the same infinite aircraft carriers.===

Address 0-1 (hotel dweller) stays because 1-0-0-0-1 moves to room 10,001.

and so on.

==Infinite layers of nesting==

Each pod holds 10 people.

Each megapod holds 10 pods. (100 people)

Each supermegapod holds 10 megapods. (1,000 people)

Each superdupermegapod holds 10 supermegapods.

Each ultrasuperdupermegapod holds 10 superdupermegapod.

Each ultrasuperduperubermegapod holds 10 ultrasuperdupermegapods. (1,000,000 people)

And so on.
This assumes that there is never an infinitieth layer. (The main ship)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">{{italictitle}}
'''''Reductio ad absurdum''''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase which means &quot;reduction to the absurd&quot;. The phrase describes a kind of [[indirect proof]]. It is a proof by [[wikt:contradiction|contradiction]],&lt;ref name=&quot;weston43&quot;&gt;Weston, Anthony. (2009). [http://books.google.com/books?id=FtRN5QKMBnEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq= ''A Rulebook for Arguments,'' pp. 43-44].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a common form of [[argument]]. It shows that a [[statement]] is true because its [[wikt:denial|denial]] leads to a false or absurd result.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/r/reductio.htm |work = The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title = Reductio ad absurdum |author = Nicholas Rescher |accessdate = 21 July 09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wikt:ridiculous|ridiculous]] or &quot;''absurdum''&quot; conclusion of a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument can have many forms.  For example,
* Rocks have weight, otherwise we would see them floating in the air.
* Society must have laws, otherwise there would be chaos.
*There is no smallest positive [[rational number]], because if there were, it could be divided by two to get a smaller one.

== History ==
The phrase can be traced back to the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''η εις  άτοπον απαγωγή'' (''hê eis átopon apagogê''). This phrase means &quot;reduction to the impossible&quot;. It was often used by [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Thomas Little 1908. [http://books.google.com/books?id=UhgPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq= ''The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements,'' Vol. 1, p. 136].&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used a number of times in ''[[Euclid's Elements]]''.

==Method==
''Reduction ad absurdum'' can be a tool of discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Polya, Goerge. (2008).  [http://books.google.com/books?id=X3xsgXjTGgoC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=  ''How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method,'' p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of proving something works by first assuming something about it. Then other things are deduced from that. If there is a contradiction, it shows that the first something cannot be correct.  For example, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:To prove '''A''' is [[wikt:true|true]], [[wikt:correct|correct]], [[wikt:valid|valid]], [[wikt:credible|credible]] ....
::Assume the opposite --  that &quot;not-'''A'''&quot; is true....
::Assume that if &quot;not-'''A'''&quot; is true, then it must mean or [[wikt:imply|imply]] '''B'''.
::Show that '''B''' is [[wikt:false|false]], [[wikt:incorrect|incorrect]], [[wikt:invalid|invalid]], [[wikt:incredible|incredible]] ...
:Therefore, '''A''' must be true after all.&lt;ref name=&quot;weston43&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Definition ==

The '''trigonometric functions''' sometimes are also called circular functions. They are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of an [[angle]]; they are important when studying [[triangle (geometry)|triangles]], among many other applications. Trigonometric functions are commonly defined as [[ratio]]s of two sides of a right triangle containing the angle, and can equivalently be defined as the lengths of various line segments from a [[unit circle]] (a circle that has a radius of one). 

=== Right triangle definitions ===
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|thumb|A [[right triangle]] always includes a 90° (π/2 radians) angle, here labeled C.  Angles A and B may vary.  Trigonometric functions specify the relationships between side lengths and interior angles of a right triangle.]]

In order to define the trigonometric functions for the angle ''A'', start with a [[right triangle]] that contains the angle ''A'':

We use the following names for the sides of the triangle:
* The ''[[hypotenuse]]'' is the side opposite the right angle, or defined as the longest side of a right-angled triangle, in this case '''h'''.
* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle we are interested in, in this case '''a'''.
* The ''adjacent side'' is the side that is in contact with the angle we are interested in and the right angle, hence its name. In this case the adjacent side is '''b'''.

All triangles are taken to exist in [[Euclidean geometry]] so that the inside angles of each triangle sum to π [[radian]]s (or 180[[degree (angle)|°]]); therefore, for a right triangle the two non-right angles are between zero and π/2 radians.  The reader should note that the following definitions, strictly speaking, only define the trigonometric functions for angles in this range.  We extend them to the full set of real arguments by using the [[unit circle]], or by requiring certain symmetries and that they be [[periodic function]]s.

1) The '''sine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\sin A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {a} {h}.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that this ratio does not depend on the particular right triangle chosen, as long as it contains the angle ''A'', since all those triangles are [[similar triangle|similar]].

The set of zeroes of sine (i.e., the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;\sin x =0&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{n\pi\big| n\isin\mathbb{Z}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

2) The '''cosine''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\cos A = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {b} {h}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of zeroes of cosine is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi\bigg| n\isin\mathbb{Z}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

3) The '''tangent''' of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In our case
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {a} {b}.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of zeroes of tangent is
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{n\pi\big| n\isin\mathbb{Z}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The same set of the sine function since
:&lt;math&gt;\tan A = \frac {\sin A}{\cos A}.&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining three functions are best defined using the above three functions.

4) The '''cosecant''' csc(''A'') is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of sin(''A''), i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the opposite side:
:&lt;math&gt;\csc A = \frac {\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\textrm{opposite}} = \frac {h} {a} &lt;/math&gt;.

5) The '''secant''' sec(''A'') is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of cos(''A''), i.e. the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the adjacent side:
:&lt;math&gt;\sec A = \frac {\textrm{hypotenuse}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {h} {b} &lt;/math&gt;.

6) The '''cotangent''' cot(''A'') is the [[multiplicative inverse]] of tan(''A''), i.e. the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the opposite side:
:&lt;math&gt;\cot A = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{opposite}} = \frac {b} {a} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Definitions by power series ===
One can define the trigonometric functions also by using [[power series]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt;

and define tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant using identities, see below.

==Identities==
Some important [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos 2x = \cos x \cos x - \sin x \sin x = \cos^2 x - \sin^2 x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1 = 1 - 2 \sin^2 x&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan 2x = \frac{2 \tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \left(x \pm y \right)=\sin x \cos y \pm \cos x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \left(x \pm y \right)=\cos x \cos y \mp \sin x \sin y&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \left ( x \pm y \right ) = \frac{\tan x \pm \tan y}{1 \mp \tan x \tan y}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1579">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a '''pseudovector''' (or '''axial vector''') is a quantity that transforms like a [[vector]] under a proper [[rotation]], but gains an additional sign flip under an [[improper rotation]] (a transformation that can be expressed as an inversion followed by a proper rotation).&lt;ref&gt;A simple example of an improper rotation in 3D (but not in 2D) is a coordinate [[inversion]]: '''x''' goes to −'''x''', '''y''' to −'''y''' and '''z''' to −'''z'''. Under this transformation, '''a''' and '''b''' go to −'''a''' and −'''b''' (by the definition of a vector), but '''p''' clearly does not change. It follows that any improper rotation multiplies '''p''' by −1 compared to the rotation's effect on a true vector.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical examples ==
Physical examples of pseudovectors include the [[magnetic field]], [[torque]], [[vorticity]], and the [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;Often, the distinction between vectors and pseudovectors is overlooked, but it becomes important in understanding and exploiting [[Symmetry in physics|the effect of symmetry on the solution to physical systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">A '''number line''' is a [[line]] with [[integer]]s (simply ordinary numbers, ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...) on it extending forever in both directions. Usually, zero (0) is placed in the middle of the line. The numbers have an equal space from each other. Other numbers in between the numbers on the line represent rational, irrational, and other types of [[real numbers]].

There is another '''number line''', equally valid and useful, that extends vertically through 0 (the origin) at right angles to our traditional number line and uses [[imaginary numbers]] (''i''). These so called '''imaginary numbers''' extend above and below the traditional number line and are used in very real calculations in many areas of science and technology and also extend in both directions forever (into infinity).

[[File:Number-line.svg|center]]

==Different forms==
A number line is usually drawn as a simple [[wikt:horizontal|horizontal]] line. Another form is the [[Helix|helical]] number line. If the line of numbers is wrapped around a [[cylinder]] following an upward helical path, it becomes a helical number line.
If the [[circumference]] of the cylinder is equal to the length occupied by ten numbers on the number line, it then becomes a [[decimal]] helical number line, and the numbers arrange themselves into columns, each number in a particular column having the same number ending.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1932">'''Binary''' is a way to show any type of data (such as numbers and text) using only 1 and 0. [[Computer]]s work in binary.

Binary is a [[Base (mathematics)|number system]] and is known as a [[Base (mathematics)|base]] 2 system because it uses two [[character (computing)|character]]s – 0 and 1. Decimal, the system most of the world uses for daily life, is a base 10 system – it uses 10 characters (0–9).

== Number system ==
{{main|Binary numeral system}}
1101 is an example of a binary number. Here is how to change binary numbers to [[decimal]] numbers (base 10, the kind most people use): The [[value]] of the [[bit]] (binary 1 or 0) on the [[position|right]] side of the number is 1. Every other bit has a value two [[multiplication|times]] the value of the bit to its right. So the place values of the binary number 1101 are 8, 4, 2, and 1. Add the values of every bit that is a 1 together to get the decimal number. Thus the code 1101 converted into decimal number will be 13.

For another example, the binary number '''101''' is '''5''' in decimal. The bit on the right is 1 and has a value of 1. The middle bit has a value of 2 (1 times 2), but it is a 0, so it is not added. The bit on the left is 1 and has a value of 4 (2 times 2). The bits that are 1s have values of 1 and 4. 1 + 4 = '''5'''.

== Computers ==

All computers use binary at the [[machine code|lowest level]]. Most [[computer storage]], like [[compact disc]]s and [[DVD]]s, use binary to [[represent]] large [[Computer file|files]]. 

With computers, eight binary bits together is called a ''[[byte]]''. The size of files is commonly [[measure]]d in ''[[kilobyte]]s'' or ''[[megabyte]]s'' (sometimes in ''[[gigabyte]]s''). A kilobyte is 1,024 bytes. A megabyte is 1,024 kilobytes, or 1,048,576 bytes, while a gigabyte is 1,024 megabytes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2028">[[Image:Oudjat.svg|thumb|250px|The Eye of Horus]]

The '''Eye of Horus''' was an important [[symbol]] in [[ancient Egypt]]. It was the symbol of protection and Royal Power from [[Ra]] or [[Horus]].

[[Horus]] was an [[Egyptian mythology|ancient Egyptian]] [[sky god]] in the form of a [[falcon]]. The right eye represents a [[Peregrine Falcon|peregrine falcon]]'s eye and the markings around it. This includes the &quot;teardrop&quot; marking sometimes found below the eye. As the wadjet (also udjat or utchat), it also represented the [[sun]], and was associated with the Sun God Ra (Re). The &quot;mirror image&quot;, or left eye, represented the [[moon]] and the God Tehuti ([[Thoth]]). &lt;ref&gt;http://altreligion.about.com/library/glossary/symbols/bldefseyeofhorus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==In arithmetic==
{{Hiero|Eye of Horus|&lt;hiero&gt;D10&lt;/hiero&gt;|align=left|era=egypt}}
In the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[measurement]] system, the Eye Of Horus defined an Old Kingdom rounded off number one(1) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64, by throwing away 1/64.

* 1/2 was represented by smell. This was symbolized by the right side of the eye in a form of the nose.

* 1/4 was represented by sight or the sensation of light. This was symbolized by the pupil.

* 1/8 was represented by thought. This was symbolized by the [[eyebrow]].

* 1/16 was represented by hearing. This was symbolized by the left side of the eye in the form of an [[arrow]] pointing towards the [[ear]].

* 1/32 was represented by taste, by the [[sprout]]ing of [[wheat]] or [[grain]] from the planted stalk. This was symbolized by a curved tail.

* 1/64 was represented by touch. This was symbolized by a [[leg]] touching the [[ground]], or what can also be thought of as a strong [[plant]] growing into the [[surface]] of the [[earth]].

In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], a '''formal language''' is a language that is defined in a precise mathematical way. A language is defined using a set called the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the language.  The members of the alphabet are usually called ''symbols'' of the language.  The language is a set of [[sequence]]s of symbols of the alphabet.  The sequences usually have finite length. The sequences that are members of the language are called the ''words'' of the language or ''strings''.

A precise definition is that 
a formal language &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}&lt;/math&gt; is typically characterized as an [[ordered pair]] of sets &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}=(\boldsymbol{A},\boldsymbol{F})&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the alphabet, and each element of  &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{F} &lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of elements. 

Formal languages have lots of uses.  A formal language is often thought of as: 
* a ''collection of words''
or 
* a ''collection of sentences''
In the first case, the set &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''[[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]'' of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}&lt;/math&gt;, and the  elements of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; are called ''words''.  In the second, the set &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''lexicon'' or the ''vocabulary'' of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt;, while the elements of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; are then called ''sentences''.  The mathematical theory that treats formal languages in general is known as ''formal language theory''.

Although it is common to hear the term ''formal language'' meaning natural language that is more stilted, disciplined or precise than everyday speech, this article refers to the meaning in formal language theory, in maths, logic or computer science. 

As an example of formal language, an alphabet might be &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a , b \right \}&lt;/math&gt;.  One string over that alphabet is &lt;math&gt;ababba\,&lt;/math&gt;. 

A typical language over that alphabet, containing that string, would be the set of all strings which contain the same number of symbols &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''empty word''' (that is, length-zero string) is allowed and is often denoted by &lt;math&gt; e\, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \epsilon\, &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \Lambda\, &lt;/math&gt;. While the alphabet is a finite set and every string has finite length, a language may very well have infinitely many member strings.  This is because the length of words belonging to it may be unbounded.

A question often asked about formal languages is &quot;how difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a particular language?&quot;
This is the kind of question that [[computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] ask.

== Examples ==

Some examples of formal languages:

* the set of all words over &lt;math&gt;{a, b}\,&lt;/math&gt;
* the set &lt;math&gt;\left \{ a^{n}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; is a [[natural number]] and &lt;math&gt;a^n\,&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; times
* Finite languages, such as &lt;math&gt;\{\{a,b\},\{a, aa, bba\}\}\,&lt;/math&gt;
* the set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language; or
* the set of inputs upon which a certain [[Turing machine]] halts.

== Specification ==

A formal language can be specified in a great variety of ways, such as:

* Strings produced by some [[formal grammar]] (see [[Chomsky hierarchy]]);
* Strings described or matched by a [[regular expression]];
* Strings accepted by some [[automaton]], such as a [[Turing machine]] or [[Finite state machine|finite state automaton]];
* Strings indicated by a [[decision problem|decision procedure]] (a set of related YES/NO questions) where the answer is YES.

&lt;!--
==Operations==
Several operations can be used to produce new languages from given ones. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are languages over some common alphabet.
* The ''[[concatenation]]'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings of the form &lt;math&gt;vw\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; is a string from &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; is a string from &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''intersection'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_1 \cap \boldsymbol{L}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings which are contained in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and also in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''union'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_1 \cup \boldsymbol{L}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings which are contained in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; or in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''complement''  &lt;math&gt;\complement \boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; of the language &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings over the alphabet which are not contained in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''right quotient'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}/\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings &lt;math&gt;v\,&lt;/math&gt; for which there exists a string &lt;math&gt;w\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;vw\,&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''[[Kleene star]]'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}^{*}&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings which can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;w_{1}w_{2}...w_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; with strings &lt;math&gt;w_{i}\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this includes the empty string &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;n = 0\,&lt;/math&gt; is allowed.
* The ''reverse'' &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}^{R}\,&lt;/math&gt; contains the reversed versions of all the strings in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''shuffle'' of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}\,&lt;/math&gt; consists of all strings which can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;v_{1}w_{1}v_{2}w_{2}\dots v_{n}w_{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_{1},\dots,v_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; are strings such that the concatenation &lt;math&gt;v_{1}\dots v_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_{1},\dots,w_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are strings such that &lt;math&gt;w_{1}\dots w_{n}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{L}_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1336">'''Combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]]. It is concerned with finite or [[Countable set|countable]] infinite [[set]]s. Combinatorics is part of [[discrete mathematics]]. Combinatorics are about [[graph theory]], or [[Partition of a set|Partitions]] of sets. According to [[George Pólya]], combinatorics looks at counting the number of possibilities, and about the questions whether certain configurations exist, and how to get to them.

== Permutation ==

Permutation is concerned with the following problems:
* Determining how many different ways there are to arrange a number of objects.
* Determining how many ways there are to select a number of objects from a larger set.

There are variations in the problems as follows:
* The objects may or may not be distinguishable.
* The order in which the objects are selected may or may not matter.

=== Examples ===
[[File:Permutations RGB.svg|thumb|right|All the possibilities to arrange three differently colored balls]]
* There are 6 different ways to arrange three distinguishable objects (as shown in the graphic).
* There are three different ways to select one particular orange from a basket with three oranges.
* There is only one possible way to select the apple from a basket that has one orange, one apple and one pear in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3672">In [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''group theory''' studies a type of [[algebraic structure]] called a '''group'''. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, and of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of numbers. Because group theory is also useful for studying [[symmetry]] in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].

==Definition==
A group is a [[set]] (collection) ''G'' whose members are called ''elements''. The elements can be numbers of some kind, or other abstract objects. The elements can even be material objects. There is also a ''binary operation'' which combines any two elements of ''G'' and results in another element of ''G''. This new element may be different from either of the original two, but it does not have to be. It only has to be an element of ''G''. To be a group, the following four conditions must be true of ''G'' and the operation defined over ''G'':

*''Closure'': It is required to check if the suggested operation is actually an operation on the set. If an operation is used on any elements in the group, the element that is formed will also be part of the group.
**For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', the result of the operation ''a'' • ''b'' is also in ''G''.
*''Identity element'': One element of the group is special. It is called the identity element. If the operation is used with the identity element and another element, the other element will not change.
**There exists an element ''e'' in ''G'', such that for all elements ''a'' in ''G'', the equation {{nowrap begin}}''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''{{nowrap end}} holds.
*''Associativity'': When there are many operations, it does not matter in what order they are done, the result will be the same.
**For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''G'', the equation (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'') holds.
*''Inverse element'': Every element in the group has another element in the group known as its inverse. When the operation is performed between them, the result is the identity element.
**For each ''a'' in ''G'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''G'' such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.

An important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result. This means that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' does not hold. If the order does not matter and the previous equation does hold, the group is called an [[abelian group]].

==Examples==
One example of a group is the set of [[integer|integers]] (called '''Z''') with the addition operator +. This group is called ''G'' = ('''Z''', +). Each required condition is true of ''G'', so ''G'' is a group.
*Closure: For any two integers ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', ''a'' + ''b'' is also in ''G''.
*Identity element: For any integer ''a'' in ''G'', ''a'' + 0 = ''a''. So 0 is the identity element of G.
*Associativity: For any three integers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''G'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').
*Inverse element: For any integer ''a'' in ''G'', there is a ''b'' = -''a'' in ''G'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = 0.

The addition operator is also [[commutative]] – the order of ''a'' and ''b'' does not matter. For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'' in G, ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''. Thus, ''G'' is also an abelian group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="974">A '''permutation''' is a single way of arranging a group of objects.  It is useful in [[mathematics]].   

A permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation.  If some of them chose different seats, it would be a different permutation.

==Permutations without repetitions==
The [[factorial]] has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions. The number n! is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order. For example, if we have three fruit: an orange, apple and pear, we can eat them in the order mentioned, or we can change them e.g. an apple, then a pear and finally an orange. The exact number of permutations is then &lt;math&gt;3! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6&lt;/math&gt;. The number gets extremely large as the number of items (n) goes up.

It is doing maths without using any objects or writing anything down. Mental calculation uses only the [[human]] brain. People who use mental maths use shortcuts to make the calculation easier.

== Calculation methods ==
There some [[methods]] to do mental maths. One way to do multiplications is the [[Russian peasant multiplication]]. An other way to do multiplications with two [[number]]s is to use [[Binomial theorem|binomial formulas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">A '''mathematical proof''' is a way to show that a [[mathematics|math]] [[theorem]] is true. One must show that the theory is true in all cases.

There are different ways of proving a mathematical theorem.

== Proof by Induction ==
{{main|Mathematical induction}}

One type of proof is called proof by [[induction]]. This is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers. There are 4 steps in a proof by induction.

1. State that the proof will be by induction, and state which variable will be used in the induction step.

2. Prove that the statement is true for some beginning case.

3. Assume that for some value ''n'' = ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement. This is called the '''induction step'''.

4. Show that the statement is true for the next value, ''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''+1.

Once that is shown, then it means that for any value of ''n'' that is picked, the next one is true. Since it's true for some beginning case (usually ''n''=1), then it's true for the next one (''n''=2). And since it's true for 2, it must be true for 3. And since it's true for 3, it must be true for 4, etc. Induction shows that it is always true, precisely because it's true for whatever comes after any given number.

An example of proof by induction:

Prove that for all [[natural numbers]] ''n'', 2(1+2+3+....+''n''-1+''n'')=''n''(''n''+1)

Proof: First, the statement can be written &quot;for all natural numbers ''n'', 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k&lt;/math&gt;=n(n+1)

By induction on n,

First, for n=1, 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^1 k&lt;/math&gt;=2(1)=1(1+1), so this is true.

Next, assume that for some ''n''=''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' the statement is true. That is, 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k&lt;/math&gt; = n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1)

Then for ''n''=''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''+1, 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{{n_0}+1} k&lt;/math&gt;
can be rewritten 2(''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''+1) + 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k&lt;/math&gt;

Since 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k&lt;/math&gt; = n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1),
2''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''+1 + 2&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k&lt;/math&gt; = 2(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1) + 2n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1)

So 2(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1) + 2n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1)= 2(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1)(n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + 2)

== Proof by Contradiction ==
Proof by [[contradiction]] is a way of proving a mathematical theorem by showing that if the statement is false, there is a problem with the logic of the proof. That is, if one of the results of the theorem is assumed to be false, then the proof does not work.

When proving a theorem by way of contradiction, it is important to note that in the beginning of the proof. This is usually abbreviated BWOC. When the contradiction appears in the proof, there is usually an X made with 4 lines instead of 2 placed next to that line.

== Other Examples of Proofs ==
Prove that x = -b ± ( √b² - 4ac ) / 2a from ax²+bx+c=0
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+2xy+y^2 = (x+y)^2\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Dividing the quadratic equation
:&lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0\!&lt;/math&gt;

by ''a'' (which is allowed because ''a'' is non-zero), gives:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a}  x + \frac{c}{a}=0\!&lt;/math&gt;

or
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x= -\frac{c}{a} \qquad (1)\!&lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic equation is now in a form in which completing the square can be done.
To &quot;complete the square&quot; is to find some number ''k'' so that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + k = x^2+2xy+y^2\!&lt;/math&gt;

for another number ''y''. In order for these equations to be true,
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{b}{2a}\!&lt;/math&gt;

and 
:&lt;math&gt;k = y^2\!&lt;/math&gt;

so
:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Adding this number to equation (1) makes
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}=-\frac{c}{a}+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The left side is now a [[perfect square]] because
:&lt;math&gt;x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2} = \left( x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2\!&lt;/math&gt;

The right side can be written as a single fraction, with common denominator 4''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This gives
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the [[square root]] of both sides gives
:&lt;math&gt;\left|x+\frac{b}{2a}\right| = \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\  }}{|2a|}\Rightarrow x+\frac{b}{2a}=\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\  }}{2a}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Getting ''x'' by itself gives
:&lt;math&gt;x=-\frac{b}{2a}\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\  }}{2a}=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\  }}{2a}\!&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9197">In [[dimensional analysis]], a '''dimensionless quantity''' (or more precisely, a '''quantity with the dimensions of 1''') is a [[quantity]] without any [[physical unit]]s and thus a pure number. Such a number is typically defined as a [[product (mathematics)|product]] or [[ratio]] of [[quantity|quantities]] which do have units, in such a way that all the units cancel out.
 
== Example ==
''&quot;out of every 10 apples I gather, 1 is rotten.&quot;'' -- the rotten-to-gathered ratio is (1 apple) / (10 apples) = 0.1 = 10%, which is a dimensionless quantity. 

== List of dimensionless quantities ==
There are infinitely many dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]] and they are often called numbers. Some of those that are used most often have been given names, as in the following list of examples (alphabetical order):

Typically, this involves finding a [[secret key]]. In non-technical language, this is the practice of '''codebreaking''' or '''cracking the code''', although &quot;break&quot; can also mean just a part of a complete solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2662">'''Binomial expansion''' uses an expression to make a series. It uses a bracket expression like &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n&lt;/math&gt;. There are three binomial expansions.

== The formulas ==
There are basically three binomial expansion formulas:
:{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2 ab + b^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| ''1st'' (Plus)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2 ab + b^2&lt;/math&gt;
|
|''2nd'' (Minus)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;(a+b) \cdot (a-b) = a^2 - b^2&lt;/math&gt;
|
|''3rd'' (Plus-Minus)
|}

We can explain why there are such 3 formulas with a simple expansion of the product:
: &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^2=(a+b)\cdot(a+b)=a \cdot a+a \cdot b+b \cdot a+b \cdot b=a^2+2 \cdot a \cdot b+b^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a-b)^2=(a-b) \cdot (a-b)=a \cdot a-a \cdot b-b \cdot a+b \cdot b=a^2-2 \cdot a \cdot b+b^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(a+b) \cdot (a-b)=a \cdot a-a \cdot b+b \cdot a-b \cdot b=a^2-b^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Using Pascal's triangle ==

If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integer]] (&lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;), we use [[Pascal's Triangle|Pascal's triangle]].


To expand &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^2&lt;/math&gt;:

* find row 2 of Pascal's triangle (1, 2, 1)
* expand &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; so the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; power goes down by 1 each time from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to 0 and the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; power goes up by 1 each time from 0 up to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;
* times the numbers from Pascal's triangle with the right terms.


So &lt;math&gt;(x+y)^2 = 1x^2y^0 + 2x^1y^1 + 1x^0y^2&lt;/math&gt;


For example:

:&lt;math&gt;(3+2x)^2 = 1 \cdot 3^2 \cdot (2x)^0 + 2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot (2x)^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 \cdot (2x)^2 = 9 + 12x + 4x^2&lt;/math&gt;


So as a rule:

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n = a_0x^ny^0 + a_1x^{n-1}y^1+ a_2x^{n-2}y^2+ \cdots + a_{n-1}x^{1}y^{n-1}+ a_nx^0y^n&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number at row &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in Pascal's triangle.

=== Examples ===


:&lt;math&gt;(5+3x)^3 = 1 \cdot 5^3 \cdot (3x)^0 + 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot (3x)^1 + 3 \cdot 5^1 \cdot (3x)^2 + 1 \cdot 5^0 \cdot (3x)^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 125 + 75 \cdot 3x + 15 \cdot 9x^2 + 1 \cdot 27x^3 = 125 + 225x + 135x^2 + 27x^3&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;(5-3x)^3 = 1 \cdot 5^3 \cdot (-3x)^0 + 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot (-3x)^1 + 3 \cdot 5^1 \cdot (-3x)^2 + 1 \cdot 5^0 \cdot (-3x)^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 125 + 75 \cdot (-3x) + 15 \cdot 9x^2 + 1 \cdot (-27x^3) = 125 - 223x + 135x^2 - 27x^3&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;(7+4x^2)^5 = 1 \cdot 7^5 \cdot (4x^2)^0 + 5 \cdot 7^4 \cdot (4x^2)^1 + 10 \cdot 7^3 \cdot (4x^2)^2 + 10 \cdot 7^2 \cdot (4x^2)^3 + 5 \cdot 7^1 \cdot (4x^2)^4 + 1 \cdot 7^0 \cdot (4x^2)^5&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= 16807 + 12005 \cdot 4x^2 + 3430 \cdot 16x^4 + 490 \cdot 64x^6 + 35 \cdot 256x^8 + 1 \cdot 1024x^{10}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, = 16807 + 48020x^2 + 54880x^4 + 31360x^6 + 8960x^8 + 1024x^{10}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="618">'''Predicate logic''' is a system of mathematical [[logic]]. It uses [[predicate]]s to express the state of certain things. It is different from [[propositional logic]] because it has the concept of ''quantifiers''.  This means, that it can also express things about quantity.

The best-known quantifiers are the ''existence quantifier'' (∃) and the ''universal quantifier'' (∀) . The existence quantifier says that there is at least one (thing) that matches the predicate or formula. The universal quantifier says that all the things match a certain predicate or formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5864">[[Image:Us unemployment rates 1950 2005.png|thumb|right|This graph shows the [[unemployment rate]] by year in the [[United States]].]]
A '''graph''' is a picture designed to express words, particularly the [[connection]] between two or more quantities. You can see a graph on the right.

A simple graph usually shows the relationship between two numbers or measurements in the form of a [[grid]]. If this is a ''rectangular graph'', these two measurements will be arranged into two different lines at right angles to one another. One of these lines will be going up (the ''vertical'' [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]]). The other one will be going right (the ''horizontal'' axis). These lines (or ''axes'', the [[plural]] of axis) meet at their ends in the lower left corner of the graph.

Both of these axes have ''tick marks'' along their lengths. You can think of each axis as a [[ruler]] drawn on paper. So each measurement is indicated by the length of the associated tick mark along the particular axis.

Another word for graph is [[chart]] or [[diagram]]. However, a chart or a diagram may not relate one quantity to other quantities. ''Flowcharts'' and ''tree diagrams'' are examples of charts or diagrams that are not graphs.

__TOC__

== How to draw a simple graph ==

Let's say you wanted to make a graph showing your height as you were growing up. You might show your height in [[centimeters]] on the vertical axis and your age in years on the horizontal axis.

For example, say you were 60 centimeters tall at age 1, 85 centimeters tall at age 2 and 95 centimeters tall at age 3. You would draw an imaginary straight line passing through the 50 centimeters height mark on the vertical axis. Then you would draw a second imaginary line passing through the age of 1 year on the horizontal axis. At the place where the two imaginary lines meet (called their ''[[intersection]]''), you would then draw a dot. Really, the imaginary lines are usually replaced by ''graph paper'' (see below). The drawing of this intersection is called &quot;''plotting'' the point 50 centimeters for year 1&quot;.

You would then plot 85 centimeters for year 2 and 95 centimeters for year 3. If you had more heights for more years, you would plot years 4, 5 and so forth. When you had enough points on your graph, you could draw a line through each of the plotted points, making your graph a ''line graph''. For example, the line graph at the upper right shows the [[unemployment rate]] (as a [[percent]]) on the vertical axis and the year (from 1950 to 2005) on the horizontal axis.

Let's say you wanted a single graph showing both your height and your brother's height. This could be expressed as two sets of plotted points: one for you and one for your brother. You could use different colors to tell your plot from your brother's. Or you might plot the [[Gross Domestic Product]] (in billions of dollars) as a second line against the same years on the unemployment graph above. This would show you the relationship between GDP and unemployment.

== Uses of graphs ==
{{see also|Table (information)}}
Graphs make information easier to see. This is especially true when two or more sets of numbers are related in some way.

For example, the unemployment rates graph at the beginning of this article could be expressed in the form of a ''table''. Like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! width=&quot;50&quot; | Year
! width=&quot;100&quot; | Unemployment rate
|-
| 1950
| 4.5%
|-
| 1951
| 3.1%
|-
| 1952
| 3.4%
|-
| etc.
| 
|}

But a long string of numbers makes it difficult to see the underlying meaning. It is much simpler to understand when the table is expressed in the form of a graph. In particular, it is easier to see the relationships between the two sets of [[Information|data]]. For example, by looking at the graph you can see at a glance that unemployment was relatively low in the late sixties but relatively high in the early eighties.

[[Scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s use graphs so that they can get a better understanding of the broad meaning and importance of their data. Salesmen and businessmen often use graphs to add importance to their points in a sales or business presentation. Graphs with many plotted points may be created on a [[computer]] rather than being drawn by hand.

[[Mathematician]]s use graphs that &quot;plot themselves&quot;, without taking measurements. For example, the [[formula]] ''x = y'' says that the value of x will always be equal to the value of y. If you plot this formula as a graph, with x as the horizontal axis and y as the vertical axis, you will get a graph that looks like a straight line angled at precisely 45 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]]. The use of these graphs forms a branch of [[mathematics]] called [[analytic geometry]].

== Graph paper ==

[[Image:graph-paper.svg|thumb|right|[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] graph paper]]
Usually, graphs are created on specially designed paper called ''graph paper''. This paper has evenly drawn horizontal and vertical lines on it. On the right is an example of a sheet of graph paper.

Different types of graphs require different forms of graph paper. What we have been talking about in the article above is the commonest form of graphs and graph paper. It is known as rectangular or [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] graphs. However the evenly drawn vertical and horizontal lines on the paper are ''not'' the graph itself but are part of the ''graph paper''. The ''graph'' is the set of plotted points, along with its axes.

There are various types of graphs (and graph paper) other than Cartesian. These include: bar graphs, pie graphs, [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] graphs, scatter graphs, [[3-D|three-dimensional]] graphs, [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] graphs and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4202">The '''Halting problem''' is a problem in [[computer science]]. The problem is looking at a computer program and finding out if the program is going to run forever or not. We say that a program &quot;solves the halting problem&quot; if it can look at any other program and tell if that other program will run forever or not.

For example, a program like this:

  while True: continue;

will loop forever, but the program

  while False: continue; 

stops very quickly.

Is there a program that solves the halting problem? It turns out there is not. We prove this fact by showing that if there is a program that solves the halting problem then something impossible happens. So for the moment we will act like there really is a program that solves the halting problem. We will call it P.

  def P(F, I):
    if F(I) runs forever:
      return True;
    else:
      return False;

P can look at any program and find out if it will run forever or not. We use P to make a new program that we will call Q. What Q does is look at another program and then answer the following question: &quot;If we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, will it run forever?&quot;. We can make Q because we have P. All we need to do is to tell Q to create a new program that is the old program looking at itself, and then use P to find out if the new program runs forever or not.

  def Q(F):
    return P(F, F);

Now we make another program R. R looks at another program and asks Q for its answer on that program. If Q answers &quot;yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever&quot;, then R stops. If Q answers &quot;no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, it will not run forever&quot;, then R enters an infinite loop and runs forever.

  def R(F):
    if Q(F):
      return;                //terminate
    else:
      while True: continue;  //loop forever

Now we look at what happens if we make R look at a copy of itself. Two things can happen: it will either stop or run forever. 

If running R and making it look at a copy of itself does not run forever, then Q answered &quot;yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever&quot;. But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: &quot;yes, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever&quot;. So: If R running on a copy of itself does not run forever, then it does run forever. This is impossible.

If running R and making it look at a copy of itself runs forever, then Q answered &quot;no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever&quot;. But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: &quot;no, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever&quot;. So: If R running on a copy of itself runs forever, then it does not run forever. This is also impossible.

No matter what happens, we get an impossible situation. We did something wrong, and we need to find out what it was. Most of the things we did were not wrong. We can not say &quot;making a program look at a copy of itself is wrong&quot;, or &quot;looking at what another program said and then going into a loop if it said one thing, and stopping if it said another thing&quot; is wrong. It does not make sense to say that we are not allowed to do those things. The only thing that we did that looks like it could be wrong is that we pretended that a program like P exists in the first place. And since this is the only thing that could be wrong, and something must be wrong, this is it. This is the proof that a program like P does not exist. There is no program that solves the halting problem.

This proof was found by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1021">'''Associativity''' is a property of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] operations (like [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]). It means that if you have more than one of the same associative operator (like +) in a row, the [[order of operations]] does not matter.


For example, if you have &lt;math&gt; 2+5+10\ &lt;/math&gt;, there are two plus signs (+) in a row. This means we can add it in either this order:

: &lt;math&gt; (2+5)+10=(7)+10=17\ &lt;/math&gt;

Or this order:

: &lt;math&gt; 2+(5+10)=2+(15)=17\ &lt;/math&gt;

The answer comes out the same both ways because addition is associative.
In other words, associativity means:

: &lt;math&gt; (2+5)+10=2+(5+10)\ &lt;/math&gt;


Not all operations are associative. [[Subtraction]] is not associative, which means:

: &lt;math&gt; (10-5)-2\ne10-(5-2) &lt;/math&gt;

This is true because:
: &lt;math&gt; (10-5)-2=(5)-2=3\ &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; 10-(5-2)=10-(3)=7\ &lt;/math&gt;
And:
: &lt;math&gt; 7\ne3 &lt;/math&gt;


Also, associativity is different from [[commutativity]], which lets you move the numbers around.

'''Reed-Solomon error correction''' is an [[error-correcting code]]. It works by  [[oversampling]] a [[polynomial]] constructed from the [[Information|data]]. The polynomial is evaluated at several points, and these values are sent or recorded. Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined. As long as it receives &quot;many&quot; of the points correctly, the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a &quot;few&quot; bad points. 

Reed-Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications, for example in [[Compact disc|CDs]], [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, in data transmission technologies such as [[DSL]] &amp; [[WiMAX]], and broadcast systems such as [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] and [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]].
== Overview ==
Reed-Solomon codes are [[block code]]s. This means that a fixed block of input data is processed
into a fixed block of output data. In the case of the most commonly used R-S code (255, 223) – 223 Reed-Solomon input symbols (each eight bits long) are encoded into 255 output symbols.
* Most R-S ECC schemes are systematic. This means that some portion of the output codeword contains the input data in its original form.
* A Reed-Solomon symbol size of eight bits was chosen because the decoders for larger symbol sizes would be difficult to implement with current technology. This design choice forces the longest codeword length to be 255 symbols.
* The standard (255, 223) Reed-Solomon code is capable of correcting up to 16 Reed-Solomon symbol errors in each codeword. Since each symbol is actually eight bits, this means that the code can correct up to 16 short bursts of error due to the inner convolutional decoder.

The Reed-Solomon code, like the [[convolutional code]], is a transparent code. This means that if
the channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line, the decoders will still
operate. The result will be the complement of the original data. However, the Reed-Solomon
code loses its transparency if virtual zero fill is used. For this reason it is mandatory that the
sense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed-Solomon decoding.

In the case of the [[Voyager program]] R-S codes reach near optimal performance when concatenated with the (7, 1/2) convolutional (Viterbi) inner code. Since two check symbols are required for each error to be corrected, this results in a total of 32 check symbols and 223 information symbols per codeword.

In addition, the Reed-Solomon codewords can be interleaved on a symbol basis before being
convolutionally encoded. Since this separates the symbols in a codeword, it becomes less likely
that a burst from the Viterbi decoder disturbs more than one Reed-Solomon symbol in any one
codeword.

== Basic idea ==
The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a [[polynomial]]. The code relies on a [[theorem]] from [[algebra]] that states that any ''k'' distinct points ''uniquely'' determine a polynomial of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] at most ''k''-1. 

The sender determines a degree &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; polynomial, over a [[finite field]], that represents the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; data points. The polynomial is then &quot;encoded&quot; by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than ''k'' points are actually sent. As long as sufficient values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.

In the same sense that one can correct a curve by [[interpolation|interpolating]] past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.

== History ==
The code was invented in 1960 by [[Irving S. Reed]] and [[Gustave Solomon]], who were then members of [[MIT]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]]. Their seminal article was entitled &quot;Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields.&quot;  When it was written, digital technology was not advanced enough to implement the concept. The first application, in 1982, of RS codes in mass-produced products was the [[compact disc]], where two interleaved RS codes are used. An efficient [[Berlekamp-Massey algorithm|decoding algorithm]] for large-distance RS codes was developed by [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[James Massey]] in 1969. Today RS codes are used in [[hard disk drive]], [[DVD]], telecommunication, and digital broadcast protocols.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="952">'''Applied mathematics''' is a field of [[mathematics]] which uses mathematics to solve [[problem]]s of other branches of [[science]]. There are many fields:

*[[Approximation theory]]: Sometimes it is not possible to get an exact solution to a problem, because this might take too long, or it may not be possible at all. Approximation theory looks at ways to get a solution which is close to the exact one, and which can be obtained faster.
*[[Probability]] and [[Statistics]]: How likely is it that something will happen? - If a coin is flipped 100 times, and lands heads up 53 times, is this coin good for games of chance, or should another one be taken?
*[[Optimization]] is about finding better solutions to problems.
*In [[ecology]] certain things are known about populations of animals or plants. This is usually called [[Population model]]. Biologists use them to tell how a population changes over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">== Introduction ==
In mathematics, an ''ordered pair'' is a collection of two objects, where one of the objects is first (the ''first coordinate'' or ''left projection''), and the other is second (the ''second coordinate'' or ''right projection''). An ordered pair where the first coordinate is &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the second coordinate is &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is usually written &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes it is written &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;). If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is different from &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, then the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is different from the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; - this is why it is called ''ordered''.

== [[property|Properties]] ==

If &lt;math&gt;(a_1,b_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a_2,b_2)&lt;/math&gt; are two ordered pairs, then the ''[[characteristic]]'' or ''defining'' property of ordered pairs is:
:&lt;math&gt;(a_1,b_1) = (a_2, b_2) \leftrightarrow a_1 = a_2 \and b_1 = b_2&lt;/math&gt;.

This means that two ordered pairs are equal if and only if: the first coordinates of the pairs are equal, and also the second coordinates of the pairs are equal.

== Definition ==

There are many mathematical [[definition]]s of ''ordered pair'' which have this property. The definition given here is the most common one:

:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) = \{\{a\}, \{a,b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Kuratowski|Kazimierz Kuratowski]] was the first person to make this definition.

'''Pascal's Triangle''' is a mathematical [[triangle|triangular]] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array array]. It is named after [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Blaise Pascal]], but it was used in [[China]] 3 centuries before his time.

Pascal's triangle can be made as follows. On the first [[wikt:row|row]], write only the [[number]] 1. Then, to get the numbers of following rows, add the number that can be seen above and to the left (if any) and the number above and to the right (if any) to find the new value. For example, the numbers 1 and 3 in the fourth row are added to make 4 in the fifth row.

==Uses of Pascal triangle==
The triangle has many uses in [[probability]]. It can also be used in [[binomial expansion]]s. For example

:(''x'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Notice the coefficients are the third row of Pascal's triangle: 1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1.
In general, when a binomial is raised to a positive integer power we have:

:(''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + … + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''xy''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

where the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in this expansion are precisely the numbers on row ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 of Pascal's triangle; in other words,

:&lt;math&gt;a_i = {n \choose i}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Pascal's rule==
[[wikt:formally|Formally]] speaking, the way of making the Pascal's Triangle uses [[Pascal's rule]], which states that

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative integers ''n'' and ''k'' where ''n'' ≥ ''k'' and with the initial condition

:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

==Complicated structures based on Pascal's triangle==
Pascal's triangle [[wikt:general|generalizes]] readily into higher [[dimension]]s. The three-dimensional version is called [[Pascal's pyramid]] or ''Pascal's tetrahedron''. A higher-dimensional analogue is generically called a &quot;[[Pascal's simplex]]&quot;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. See also [[pyramid]], [[tetrahedron]], and [[simplex]].

==Properties of Pascal's Triangle==
The first and last number in each row is always 1.
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose 0} = {n \choose n}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
The second number in each row is the row number. In a binomial expansion, this second number is equal to the power. (This makes the 'first' row, 1, actually the zero row). 
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose 1} = n &lt;/math&gt;
The rows always read the same forward and backward. 
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k} &lt;/math&gt;
The sum of the numbers in each row is double the sum of the numbers in the row before. The sum of each row is 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
:     The zero row, 1, has a sum of 1. 
:          &lt;math&gt; 1=2^0=1 &lt;/math&gt; 
:
:     The first row, 1,1 has a sum of 2. 
:          &lt;math&gt; 1+1=2^1=2 &lt;/math&gt;
:
:     The second row, 1,2,1 has a sum of 4. 
:          &lt;math&gt; 1+2+1=2^2=4&lt;/math&gt;
:
:     The third row, (1,3,3,1) has a sum of 8.
:         &lt;math&gt; 1+3+3+1=2^3=8 &lt;/math&gt;
:
:     The sum of the nth row is &lt;math&gt; 2^n &lt;/math&gt; 
:       &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''Trigonometry''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''trigonon'' = three angles and ''metron'' = [[measurement|measure]]) is a part of elementary [[mathematics]] dealing with [[angle]]s, [[triangle (geometry)|triangles]] and '''[[trigonometric function]]s''' such as '''sine''' (abbreviated sin), '''cosine''' (abbreviated cos) and '''tangent''' (abbreviated tan). It has some connection to [[geometry]], although there is disagreement on exactly what that connection is; for some, trigonometry is just a section of geometry.

== Overview and definitions ==
[[File:Rtriangle.svg|right|thumbnail|A standard right triangle. '''C''' is the [[right angle]] in this picture.]]
Trigonometry uses a large number of specific words to describe parts of a triangle. Some of the definitions in trigonometry are:
* '''[[Right triangle|Right-angled triangle]]''' - A right-angled triangle is a triangle that has an angle that is equal to 90 degrees. (A triangle can not have more than one right angle.) The standard trigonometric ratios can only be used on right-angled triangles.
* '''[[Hypotenuse]]''' - The hypotenuse of a triangle is the longest side, and the side that is opposite the right angle. For example, for the triangle on the right, the hypotenuse is side ''c''.
* '''[[Opposite]]''' of an angle - The opposite side of an angle is the side that does not intersect with the vertex of the angle. For example, side ''a'' is the opposite of angle ''A'' in the triangle to the right.
* '''[[Adjacent]]''' of an angle - The adjacent side of an angle is the side that intersects the vertex of the angle but is not the hypotenuse. For example, side ''b'' is adjacent to angle ''A'' in the triangle to the right.

== Trigonometric ratios ==
There are three main trigonometric [[ratio]]s for right triangles, and three [[Reciprocal|reciprocals]] of those ratios. There are 6 total ratios. They are:

'''Sine''' (sin) - The sine of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Opposite \over Hypotenuse}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Cosine''' (cos) - The cosine of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Adjacent \over Hypotenuse}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Tangent''' (tan) - The tangent of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Opposite \over Adjacent}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The reciprocals of these ratios are:

'''Cosecant''' (csc) - The cosecant of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Hypotenuse \over Opposite}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\csc \theta = {1 \over \sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Secant''' (sec) - The secant of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Hypotenuse \over Adjacent}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sec \theta = {1 \over \cos \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Cotangent''' (cot) - The cotangent of an angle is equal to the &lt;math&gt;{Adjacent \over Opposite}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\cot \theta = {1 \over \tan \theta}&lt;/math&gt;


Students often use a [[mnemonic]] to remember this relationship. The ''sine'', ''cosine'', and ''tangent'' ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them as strings of letters, such as SOH-CAH-TOA:

:'''S'''ine = '''O'''pposite ÷ '''H'''ypotenuse
:'''C'''osine = '''A'''djacent ÷ '''H'''ypotenuse
:'''T'''angent = '''O'''pposite ÷ '''A'''djacent

or:

''' S'''illy '''O'''ld '''H'''itler '''C'''ouldn't '''A'''dvance '''H'''is '''T'''roops '''O'''ver '''A'''merica

or:

'''S'''itting (or '''S'''ex) '''O'''n '''H'''ard '''C'''oncrete '''A'''lways '''H'''urts '''T'''ry '''O'''ther''' A'''lternatives

== Purpose of trigonometry ==
With the sines and cosines one can answer virtually all questions about triangles. One can work out the remaining angles and sides of any triangle as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since ''every [[polygon]] may be described as a combination of triangles''.

There is also such a thing as [[spherical trigonometry]], which deals with [[spherical geometry]]. This is used for calculations in [[astronomy]], [[geodesy]] and [[navigation]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4314">In [[mathematics]] a '''field''' is a certain kind of [[algebraic structure]]. In a field you can [[addition|add]] (&lt;math&gt;x+y&lt;/math&gt;), [[subtraction|subtract]] (&lt;math&gt;x-y&lt;/math&gt;), [[multiplication|multiply]] (&lt;math&gt;x\cdot y&lt;/math&gt;) and [[Division (mathematics)|divide]] (&lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt;) two numbers (with division only allowed if &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to zero). A field is a special [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], in which you can divide.

== Rules ==
As the field is always a ring, it consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (represented here with the letter R) with two operations: addition (+) and multiplication (•). The properties of a ring are:
* ''Closure'': If an operation is used on any elements in the ring, the element that is formed will also be part of the ring.
** For all a, b in R, the result of the operation a + b is also in R.
** For all a, b in R, the result of the operation a • b is also in R.
* ''Additive Identity element'': One element of the ring is special. It is called the additive identity element (or zero). If addition is used with the identity element and another element, the other element will not change.
** There exists an element 0 in R, such that for all elements a in R, the equation 0 + a = a + 0 = a holds.
* ''Associativity of Addition'': When addition is done many times, it does not matter how it is grouped, the result will be the same.
** For all a, b and c in R, the equation (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) holds.

* ''[[Commutativity of addition]]'': When addition is done, it does not matter which element is on the right and left, the result will be the same.
** For all a and b in R, the equation a + b = b + a holds.
* ''Additive Inverse element'': Every element in the ring has another element in the ring when addition is performed between them, the result is the additive identity element. This is known as its additive inverse.
** For each a in R, there exists an element -a in R such that a + (-a) = 0, where 0 is the additive identity element.
* ''Associativity of multiplication'': When multiplication is done many times, it does not matter how it is grouped, the result will be the same.
** For all a, b and c in R, the equation (a • b) • c = a • (b • c) holds.

* ''Distribution'': Addition and multiplying mix together:
** For all a, b and c in R, the equation (a + b) • c = (a • c) + (b • c) holds.
** For all a, b and c in R, the equation a • (b + c) = (a • b) + (a • c) holds.

A field is a ring with these rules:
* ''Commutativity of multiplication'': When multiplication is done, it does not matter which element is on the right and left, the result will be the same.
** For all a and b in R, the equation a • b = b • a holds.
* ''Multiplicative Identity element:'' One element of the ring is special. It is called the multiplicative identity element (or unit). If multiplication is used with the identity element and another element, the other element will not change.
** There exists an element 1 in R, such that for all elements a in R, the equation 1 • a = a • 1 = a holds.
* ''Multiplicative Inverse element'': Every element element in the ring apart from the zero element (the additive identity) has an inverse. Multiplying an element by its inverse will give
** For each a in R, apart from 0, there exists an element a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; such that a • a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = a&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; • a = 1 holds.
* ''Integral domain'': Multiplying is zero is the only multiplication that produces zero.
** For all a and b in R, if a • b = 0 then either a = 0 or b = 0 must be true.


Another way of describing a field is this:
* The set R using the operation + is an abelian (commutative) [[Group (mathematics)|group]] with the zero element as its identity element.
* The set R, without the zero element, using the operation • is also an abelian group, with the unit element as its identity element.
* The field also satisfies the distribution rules, listed above.

== Examples of fields ==
Examples for fields are 
* the [[real number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[rational number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[complex number]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
The [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are not a field, because you cannot always divide without a remainder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="794">'''Order theory''' is a field of [[mathematics]]. It concerns itself with being able to compare different elements of a [[set]]. Given a [[binary relation]] it is then possible to put all the elements of the set in a certain order. It is also possible to say that a certain element &quot;comes before&quot; another one, for that relation. Another way to say this is to say that one of the two is &quot;smaller than&quot; the other.

For a specific set to be ordered it must be:

''reflexive: ''each element of the set is within a relation with itself.

''anti-symmetric:'' if A and B are in relation, and B is also in a relation with A, then A must be equal to B.

''transitive: ''if A and B in a relation, and B is in a relation with C, then A and C must be in a relation.

[[Image:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|right|thumb|Cutaway of a [[nautilus]] shell showing the chambers arranged in an approximately [[logarithmic spiral]].]]
A '''Spiral''' is a special [[curve]] in [[mathematics]]. This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a [[circle]] (which is always at the same distance or an [[ellipse]]. A spiral is an &quot;open&quot; curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.
==Two-dimensional spirals==
A [[two-dimensional]] spiral may be described most easily using [[polar coordinates]]. There the [[radius]] ''r'' is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[monotonic]] function of angle θ (''theta'').  The circle would be regarded as a [[degenerate (mathematics)|degenerate]] case. With the circle, the function would not be  strictly monotonic, but constant.

Some of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:

* The [[Archimedean spiral]]: ''r'' = ''a'' + ''b''θ
* The [[Euler spiral]], [[Cornu spiral]] or ''clothoid''
* [[Fermat's spiral]]: ''r'' = θ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
* The [[hyperbolic spiral]]: ''r'' = ''a''/θ
* The [[Lituus (mathematics)|lituus]]: ''r'' = θ&lt;sup&gt;-1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
* The [[logarithmic spiral]]: ''r'' = ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;θ&lt;/sup&gt;; approximations of this are found in nature
* The [[Fibonacci spiral]] and [[golden spiral]]: special cases of the logarithmic spiral
* The [[Spiral of Theodorus]]: an aproximation of the Archimedean spiral composed of contiguous right triangles
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Three-dimensional spirals==
For simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, ''h'' (height), is also a continuous, [[monotonic function]] of θ. For example, a [[cone|conic]] [[helix]] may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the [[apex]] an [[exponential]] function of θ.

The [[helix]] and [[vortex]] can be viewed as a kind of [[dimension|three-dimensional]] spiral.

For a helix with thickness, see [[spring (math)]].

==In nature==
[[Image:Haeckel Prosobranchia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The 53rd plate from [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s ''Kunstformen der Natur'' (1904), showing organisms classified as [[Prosobranchia]] (now known to be polyphyletic).]]
The study of spirals in [[nature]] have a long history, [[Christopher Wren]] found out that many [[Animal shell|shells]] form a [[logarithmic spiral]]. [[Jan Swammerdam]] observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from ''[[Helix (genus)|Helix]]'' to ''[[Spirula]]'' and [[Henry Nottidge Moseley]] described the mathematics of [[univalve]] [[Animal shell|shells]]. [[D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson|D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson]]'s ''On Growth and Form'' gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the [[shape]] of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a [[geometric progression]]. In some shell such as ''[[Nautilus]]'' and [[ammonite]]s the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a [[helix|helico]]-spiral pattern.

Thompson also studied spirals occurring in [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s, [[teeth]], [[claw]]s and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=D'Arcy|last=Thompson|title=On Growth and Form|date=1917,1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as [[whorl]]s.

A model for the pattern of [[floret]]s in the head of a [[sunflower]] was proposed by H Vogel. This has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = n \times 137.5^{\circ},\ r = c \sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index number of the floret and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of [[Fermat's spiral]]. The angle 137.5° is related to the [[golden ratio]] and gives a close packing of florets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.

==As a symbol==
[[Image:Newgrange Entrance Stone.jpg|thumb|The Newgrange entrance slab]]
The spiral plays an important role in [[Symbolism (art)|symbolism]]. It appears in [[megalithic]] [[art]], notably in the [[Newgrange]] tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also [[triple spiral]].

Scholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the [[sun]].  Roof [[tile]]s from the [[Tang Dynasty]] with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of [[Chang'an]] (modern-day Xian).

The spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent.  Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the &quot;life-death-rebirth&quot; cycle.  Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning.   

Spirals are also a symbol of [[hypnosis]]. This most likely comes from the [[cliché]] of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being [[Kaa]] in Disney's ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''). They are also used as a symbol of [[dizziness]], where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in [[anime]] and [[manga]], will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral is also a prominent symbol in the anime ''[[Gurren Lagann]]'', where it symbolizes the [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]], representing biological [[evolution]], and the spiral structure of a [[galaxy]], representing [[universal evolution]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2155">[[File:Kugleramme.jpg|thumb|Abacus]]

An '''abacus''' is a very old tool used for math. It is still used in some parts of the world. Sometimes [[blind]] people will use an abacus, because they can [[feel]] the [[number]]s easily. The most common abacuses work by moving beads on rods.

Abacuses can do [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], and people can use them to find the [[square root]] of [[whole number]]s. Expert, or very good, abacus users can sometimes do math quicker than basic [[calculator]]s. There is a common Chinese abacus. This abacus is split into two kinds of basic rows, the top is for the &quot;5&quot;s, and the bottom is for the &quot;ones&quot;. There are one or two beads in the top rows, and four or five beads in the bottom ones. For example, 8 is one bead on top and 3 below, because 5 + 3 = 8. Every column represents a different digit. The Abacus is really useful for math and is really fun to mess around with and just have fun with. Good to get for young children as toys or to help them learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1886">A '''square root''' of a number is a number that, when it is multiplied by itself (squared), gives the first number again. For example, 2 is the square root of 4, because 2×2=4. Only numbers bigger than or equal to zero have real square roots. A number bigger than zero has two square roots: one is [[positive number|positive]] (bigger than zero) and the other is [[negative number|negative]] (smaller than zero). For example, 4 has two square roots: 2 and −2. The only square root of zero is zero.

Square roots of negative numbers are not [[real number]]s – they are [[imaginary numbers]]. Imaginary numbers are basically numbers that cannot be square rooted and get a real result. Every [[complex number]] except 0 has 2 square roots. For example: −1 has two square roots. We call them &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;.

The sign for a square root is made by putting a bent line over a number, like this: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt 4&lt;/math&gt;. We say &quot;the square root of 4&quot; (or whatever number we are taking the square root of).

A [[whole number]] with a square root that is also a whole number is called a [[square number|perfect square]]. The first few perfect squares are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1024, 1089, 1156, 1225...

== Origin of the Symbol ==
It is not really known where the square root symbol &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\,\,}&lt;/math&gt; comes from, but some people believe that it was from the [[letter]] ''r'', which is the first letter of the [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] word ''radix''. Radix means root or base. Thus, radix quadratum from Latin refer most likely to the base of a square. As the sides of a square are all equal, the word radix may be interpreted as side of a square, even not literally meaning that.

      <comment>/* Numbers in different bases */ Correction 1(base 10) is 1(base 2), not 2(which doesn't exist as a symbol in base 2)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2537">In [[mathematics]], a '''base''' or '''radix''' is the number of different [[digit]]s that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because &quot;dec&quot; means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9.

A base can be any whole [[number]] bigger than 0 (if it was 0, then there would be no digits). Sometimes, to show that a number is in a different base to the decimal system, the base that it is in is typed after it, smaller than the number. For instance, &lt;math&gt;23_8 \ &lt;/math&gt; means 23 in base 8 (which is equal to 19 in base 10). Most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.

== Uses of bases ==
=== In computers ===
Different bases are often used in [[computers]]. Binary (base 2) is used because at the most simple level, computers can only deal with 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal (base 16) is used because of how computers group binary digits together. Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them. Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are shown as A, B, C, D, E, and F.

=== Measurement ===
The oldest systems of counting used base one.  Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting.  Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix (base twelve). This is shown in [[English language|English]], as there are words such as dozen (12) and gross; 144 = 12(12), and lengths such as feet (12 [[inches]]).bases are used as a converter for various numbers.

== Writing bases ==
When typing a base, the small number which shows how many digits in that base is usually in base 10. This is because if the radix was written in the base it is, it would always be 10, so there would be no way of knowing what base it was. 

== Numbers in different bases==
Here are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases.

The '''infinite monkey theorem''' says that a [[monkey]] randomly hitting keys on a [[typewriter]] will eventually type out one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. When people talk about the [[infinite]] monkey theorem, the &quot;monkey&quot; is not always a real monkey. Instead, it is an example of a device that produces random letters. However, the chances of a monkey actually typing a text, like Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', are very small.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks], Ute Hoffmann &amp; Jeanette Hofmann, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung gGmbH (WZB), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58790,00.html |title=Monkeys Don't Write Shakespeare |author=Associated Press |publisher=Wired News |date= 2003-05-09| accessdate = 2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arthur Eddington | title=The Nature of the Physical World: The Gifford Lectures | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1928 | pages=72 | isbn=0-8414-3885-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mutual information''' measures how much more is known about one random [[value]] when given another. For example, knowing the [[temperature]] of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is, but it will give some ''hint''. In the same way, knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature, but will make certain temperatures ''more or less likely''. These ''hints'' or ''changes in likelihood'' are explained and measured with mutual information.

== Calculating mutual information ==
=== Required information ===
To calculate mutual information, the [[probability]] (chance) of all possible events, and the probability of them happening at the same time, is needed. For example, to measure mutual information between '''month''' and '''temperature''' we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius, how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March.

=== Formula ===
The formula requires the summation, or adding up, of many terms or numbers. Every possible outcome has its own term. From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature, we will use the following variables:
* p(x,y) = probability of it being '''x''' degrees Celsius in month '''y'''
* t(x) = probability of it being '''x''' degrees Celsius (on any day of the year)
* m(y) = probability of it being month '''y'''

This means m(3) equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March. This is 31/365, or about 0.085, since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March.

One term would be as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; p(x,y) \log{ \left( \frac{p(x,y)}{t(x)m(y)}
                              \right) } \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &quot;log&quot; means [[Logarithmic scale|logarithm]].

Adding all possible terms together gives the value for mutual information.

== Understanding mutual information ==
=== Possible values ===
The larger the mutual information, the more you can learn about one random value (e.g. month) when told another (e.g. temperature).

* If mutual information is zero, you cannot determine anything about one value when given another.
** For example, knowing if you got heads or tails in a coin flip last time will not tell you anything about what will happen next time.

* If mutual information is small, there may still be no mutual information. Sometimes random events seem to have a pattern in the short term, but overall there is no mutual information.

* If mutual information is large, there is likely some connection between the two things being looked at.
** Since ''temperature'' and ''month'' are connected, their mutual information would be a lot larger than zero.
** It is not easy to know if mutual information is significant or ''large''.

* If mutual information is one, then knowing one value will exactly tell you the other.
** For example, if a random desk is selected in a classroom, a teacher can know exactly which student will sit there. Knowing which desk was selected tells us exactly which student is connected to it.

=== Important facts ===
Mutual information does not change based on which random value is revealed. This means we know just as much about ''temperature when told the month'' as we know about ''the month when told the temperature''.

Mutual information is difficult to compare. If we calculate mutual information for weather and another value for a card game, the two values cannot easily be compared.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1250">:''This is about distribution in a mathematical sense, other meanings can be found at [[distribution]]''
In [[mathematics]], a '''distribution''' is a generalisation of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. Distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by [[Laurent Schwartz]], who received a [[Fields Medal]] for his work on them. The Fields medal is comparable to a [[Nobel Prize]] in mathematics, which does not exist. 

Distributions were introduced to model certain concepts from Physics. Physics has the concept of a ''mass of points in space''. The [[Dirac delta function]] can model an [[electromagnetic]] charge of a point in space. The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere, except at one point, where it is infinitely large. This needs to be the case, because the density function needs to be 1. There is no function that can meet this criterion, except if integraton is taken as a ''function'' in the mathematical sense.

Today, distributions are used in different fields of mathematics and physics, for example to model [[Partial differential equation]]s or [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyses]], which are important for [[Quantum electrodynamics]] or [[signal processing]].

A '''topological space''' is a space studied in [[topology]], the mathematics of the structure of shapes. Roughly, it is a [[set]] of things (called [[points]]) along with a way to know which things are close together.

More precisely, a topological space has a certain kind of set, called ''open sets''. Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points ''near'' another point, called a '''neighbourhood''' of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as ''any'' set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.
We also have the concept of ''closed sets'', which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.

Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The [[Union (set theory)|union]] of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a [[finite]] number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an [[infinite]] number of closed sets, then ''every'' set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed.

A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is. One can think of only certain sets as open, or more sets as open. One might even consider every set to be open. The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], '''Spearman's rank correlation coefficient''' is a measure of [[correlation]], named after its maker, [[Charles Spearman]]. It is written in short as the Greek letter ''rho'' (&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) or sometimes as &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;. This means that it is a number that shows how closely two sets of [[Information|data]] are linked. It only can be done on data that can be put in order, highest to lowest.

The general formula for &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\rho=1-\cfrac {6\sum d^2}{n(n^2-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if you have data for how expensive different [[computers]] are, and data for how fast the computers are, you could see if they are linked, and how closely they are linked, using &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;.

== Working it out ==
=== Step one ===
To work out &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; you first have to ''rank'' each piece of data. We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed.

So, the computer with the lowest price would be rank '''1'''. The one higher than that would have '''2'''. Then, it goes up until it is all ranked. You have to do this to both sets of data.Just use your mathematics skills my friend. Omar Zouaoui.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGP-book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Richard |title=GCSE Statistics |publisher=[http://www.cgpbooks.co.uk Coordination Group Publications] |year= 2008 |isbn= 184762149X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| {{table}}

| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Price ($)'''

| C||300||3||2.20||4
|-
| D||350||4||2.10||3
|-
| E||600||5||4.00||5
|-
| 


=== Step two ===
Next, we have to find the ''difference'' between the two ranks. Then, you multiply the difference times itself, which is called squaring. The difference is called &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and the number you get when you square &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;is called &lt;math&gt;d^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=CGP-book/&gt;

| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''&lt;math&gt;d^2&lt;/math&gt;'''

|-
| 2||1||1||1
|-
| 3||4||-1||1
|-
| 4||3||1||1
|-
| 5||5||0||0
|-
| 


=== Step three ===
Count how much data we have. This data has ranks 1 to 5, so we have 5 pieces of data. This number is called &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=CGP-book/&gt;

=== Step four ===
Finally, use everything we have worked out so far in this formula: &lt;math&gt; r_s=1-\cfrac {6\sum d^2}{n(n^2-1)}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\sum d^2&lt;/math&gt; means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column &lt;math&gt;d^2&lt;/math&gt;. This is because &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; means total.

So, &lt;math&gt;\sum d^2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1+1+1+1&lt;/math&gt; which is 4. The formula says multiply it by 6, which is 24.

&lt;math&gt;n(n^2-1)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;5*(25-1)&lt;/math&gt; which is 120.

So, to find out &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;, we simply do &lt;math&gt;1-\cfrac {24}{120} = 0.8 &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.8 for this set of data.

== What the numbers mean ==
[[File:Positive correltion lobf.JPG|thumb|This scatter graph has positive correlation. The &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; value would be near 1 or 0.9. The red line is a line of best fit.]]&lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; always gives an answer between −1 and 1. The numbers between are like a scale, where −1 is a very strong link, 0 is no link, and 1 is also a very strong link. The difference between 1 and −1 is that 1 is a positive correlation, and −1 is a negative correlation.  A graph of data with a &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; value of −1 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right.

For example, for the data that we did above, &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt; was 0.8. So this means that there is a positive correlation. Because it is close to 1, it means that the link is strong between the two sets of data. So, we can say that those two sets of data are ''linked'', and go ''up'' together. If it was −0.8, we could say it was ''linked'' and as one goes up, the other goes down.

== If two numbers are the same ==
Sometimes, when ranking data, there are two or more numbers that are the same. When this happens in &lt;math&gt;r_s&lt;/math&gt;, we take the [[mean]] or average of the ranks that are the same. These are called ''tied'' ranks. To do this, we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied. Then, we add up all the ranks that they would have, and divide it by how many there are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics4u.info/fundstat_eng/cc_corr_spearman.html Spearman's Rank at www.statistics4u.info]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test.

{| {{table}}

| 6||3||&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {2+3+4}{3} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 6||4||&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {2+3+4}{3} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 8||5||&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {5+6}{2} = 5.5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 8||6||&lt;math&gt;\tfrac {5+6}{2} = 5.5&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 


These numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks.

'''Big O Notation''' is a way of saying how much time it takes for a mathematical [[algorithm]] to run or how much [[computer memory|memory]] it uses.

The Big O Notation is often used in identifying how complex a problem is (also known as the problem's [[complexity class]]).

==Use==

It is an expression that is meant to give a person a feel for the worst case time and/or space requirements of a program without them having to actually code and run the program on a real computer. This is also advantageous since different computers may have different hardware specifications and may produce the answer in different amounts of time should any program be run on them. The Big O notation, on the other hand, remains the same even if you're running a program on your desktop, a server or a supercomputer.

Let us see how big O is used in practice. Consider for example that we're trying to find the maximum number from a given set of numbers. To find it, we have to look at each and every number in the set. If we were given twice the numbers, we would take twice as long to find the maximum number. Thus, finding the maximum in a set is &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; - the time or number of steps required to find an answer increases or decreases directly with increase or decrease in the size of the input. On the other hand, if an algorithm were said to be &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;, then the time taken to produce the output would take a time that would square in magnitude with change in size of the input - for e.g. if someone gave an input that was twice as large as an initial input, the time taken would be &lt;math&gt;n^2 = 2^2 = 4 &lt;/math&gt; times as large.

Notice that when we're talking about Big O, we mean the big picture. We're not talking about how the time changes when we're given a set of 10 or 20 numbers (in fact the big O, due to its mathematical definition, may even give wrong bounds at these small scales). Instead, we're considering a huge bulk of data - talk about analyzing data from the Hubble Telescope, for example - where you have 120GB of data pouring in every week. In such situations, it becomes unnecessary to give the &quot;exact&quot; relation between the input and the size of growth. Thus you won't find expressions like &lt;math&gt;O(n + 3)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 + 3n + 5)&lt;/math&gt; - the &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; in the first case and the &lt;math&gt;3n + 5&lt;/math&gt; in the second case are trivial when compared to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and the  &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; terms respectively. So, you simply write them as &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt;. Expressions like &lt;math&gt;O(3n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(2n^2)&lt;/math&gt; are avoided as well, because what we need is a gist of how the time for the output changes with the input. So again the expressions are written as &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; (actually speaking, the provision for this coefficient is contained in the mathematical definition of the Big O). 

'''Little-o Notation:''' 

A stricter version of the big O is the little-o. The difference between big O and little-o is that little-o is a strict upper bound. While the big O says that &quot;the requirement may get as worse as this but not more&quot;, the little-o says that the &quot;requirement will definitely not get worse than this&quot;. As an example, if I say that a program is &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;, then it means that the time requirement may grow directly with the size of the input, but if I say that a program is &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. little-o of n, then I'm saying that the time requirement will definitely not grow directly in proportion to the size of the input, the growth rate is somewhere less than it. So in a way, &lt;math&gt;o(n)&lt;/math&gt;  is better than &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;, if we're seeking to reduce the time.
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Math-stub}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">Signed Number representations are used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary. The problem of trying to store the [[Negative number|negative sign]] (−) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign.

To overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers: [[#Sign-and-magnitude|sign-and-magnitude]] and [[#2's complement|2's complement]]. These produce alternative '''representations for signed numbers'''.

==Sign-and-magnitude==
'''Sign and Magnitude''' works by changing the most significant bit (MSB - the first digit) to a 1 if the number is negative, and reduce the number by one, for example:

:0000 0010 (2)
will become...
:1000 0010 (-2)

This method of storing negative binary numbers does not work because:

*[[Binary arithmetic]] won't work.
*We must first know which storage mechanism the compiler of a particular language uses.

==2's complement==
'''2's Complement''' is a more difficult way of storing negatives. There are three steps for it:

# Find the positive binary number (e.g. 8&lt;sub&gt;base 10&lt;/sub&gt; = 0000 1000&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt;).
# Swap the 1s for 0s and the 0s for 1s (e.g. 0000 1000&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt; becomes 1111 0111&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt;).
#:This is known as &quot;flipping the bits&quot;, or applying logical NOT to the original base 2 representation.
# Add 1 (e.g. 1111 0111&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt; + 1&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1111 1000&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt;).

This method is liked because:

* It's like sign and magnitude; a negative number starts with a 1 and a positive number starts with a 0.
* The binary arithmetic will work.
* There is only one value for 0 (0000 0000&lt;sub&gt;base 2&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">[[Real number]]s in [[binary]] have to be stored in a special way in a [[computer]]. There is no [[decimal]] point in the binary system so the computer has a method of understanding decimals. This is called '''floating-point representation'''.

The decimal point in a real number is called a ''floating point'' because it can be placed anywhere - it is not fixed. Because of this, a computer will divide a number into two parts. These are called the '''mantissa''' and the '''exponent'''.

==Mantissa==
The mantissa is found by taking the real number and removing the decimal point, for example:

1101 . 0111 would become 1101 0111

==Exponent==
The exponent is the number of spaces the decimal point has moved. In the example above, the decimal point moved 4 places to the left, so the exponent is 0000 0100 (this is binary for 4).

If the decimal point moves to right, the exponent is negative. For example,

0000 . 0111 (mantissa - 0000 0111)
&lt;br&gt; here, the exponent is -1. The binary number for this is 1111 1111 (see [[Negative binary numbers]])

==Result==
The result is found by putting the Mantissa and Exponent together. The results for the examples above are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Decimal
! Mantissa
! Exponent
! Result
|-
| 1101 . 0111
| 1101 0111
| 0000 0100
| 1101 0111 0000 0100
|-
| 0000 . 0111
| 0000 0111
| 1111 1111
| 0000 0111 1111 1111

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1618">'''Algorithmic information theory''' is a field of [[theoretical computer science]]. It is concerned with how [[information]] and [[computation]] are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the [[complexity]] of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular [[information theory]], it uses [[Kolmogorov complexity]] to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by [[Claude Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]]. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] and [[Gregory Chaitin]] .

== Example ==
According to Claude Shannon the following two [[binary]] strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):

:&lt;tt&gt;1000110111100101&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;1111111100000000&lt;/tt&gt;


The first was generated with a [[random number generator]], for example by throwing a [[coin]]. The second is easier to describe (eight times &quot;1&quot;, then eight times &quot;0&quot;). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten (&quot;compress&quot;) the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten (&quot;compress&quot;) its description. Random strings and [[white noise]] do not contain [[pattern]]s that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value.

In applied mathematics, a branch of [[mathematics]], '''mathematical physics''' refers to the knowledge made up of [[equation]]s and ideas which [[scientists]] look to for assistance in modeling, describing, or solving problems in [[physics]] or related areas. These equations&lt;ref&gt;http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/solutions/eqindex/eqindex-mphe.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and ideas are derived from areas of [[pure mathematics]]. The equations form a consistent structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=78863&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a so-called structure is a [[noncommutative space]].

The '''Heaviside function''', ''H'' is a non-continuous [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose value is [[0 (number)|zero]] for negative argument and [[1 (number)|one]] for positive argument.

The function is used in the mathematics of [[control theory]] to represent a signal that switches on at a specified time and stays switched on indefinitely. It was named after the [[England|Englishman]] [[Oliver Heaviside]].

:&lt;math&gt; H(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x { \delta(t)} \mathrm{d}t &lt;/math&gt;

== Discrete form ==

We can also define an alternative form of the Heaviside step function as a function of a discrete variable ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;H[n]=\begin{cases} 0, &amp; n &lt; 0 \\ 1, &amp; n \ge 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is an [[integer]].

Or

:&lt;math&gt;H(x) = \lim_{z \rightarrow x^-} ((|z| / z + 1) / 2)&lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time unit impulse is the first difference of the discrete-time step

:&lt;math&gt; \delta\left[ n \right] = H[n] - H[n-1].&lt;/math&gt;

This function is the cumulative summation of the [[Kronecker delta]]:

:&lt;math&gt; H[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{n} \delta[k] \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \delta[k] = \delta_{k,0} \,&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[degenerate distribution|discrete unit impulse function]].

== Representations ==
Often an [[integral]] representation of the Heaviside step function is useful:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x)=\lim_{ \epsilon \to 0^+} -{1\over 2\pi \mathrm{i}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty {1 \over \tau+\mathrm{i}\epsilon} \mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} x \tau} \mathrm{d}\tau =\lim_{ \epsilon \to 0^+} {1\over 2\pi \mathrm{i}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty {1 \over \tau-\mathrm{i}\epsilon} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} x \tau} \mathrm{d}\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

== ''H''(0) ==

The value of the function at 0 can be defined as ''H''(0) = 0, ''H''(0) = ½ or ''H''(0) = 1. 

:&lt;math&gt; H(x) = \frac{1+\sgn(x)}{2} =
  \begin{cases} 0,           &amp; x &lt; 0
             \\ \frac{1}{2}, &amp; x = 0
             \\ 1,           &amp; x &gt; 0.
  \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Daubechies4-functions.png|thumb|Scaling and wavelet function of continuous D4 wavelet]]
'''Daubechies wavelets''' are a family of orthogonal [[wavelet]]s named after Belgian physicist and mathematician [[Ingrid Daubechies]]. They are used in [[discrete wavelet transform]].

== Definition ==
Scale function coefficients (low pass filter in [[quadrature mirror filter|orthogonal filter banks]]) must satisfy following conditions (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is length of filter).

; Normalization
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_0[n] = \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_0[n] = 2&lt;/math&gt; (then coefficients must be divided by factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;)
which implies
: &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (h_0[n])^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (h_0[n])^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt; (then coefficients must be divided by factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;)

; Orthogonality
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} h_0[n] h_0[n-2k] = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \not= 0&lt;/math&gt;
 
; Vanishing moments
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (-1)^n h_0[n] n^m = 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq m &lt; N/2&lt;/math&gt;

There is more than one solution (except case of &lt;math&gt;N=2&lt;/math&gt;). However, it is necessary to distinguish between low pass and high pass filter.

Wavelets are denoted like D''x'', where ''x'' is either number of coefficients (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) or number of vanishing moments (&lt;math&gt;N/2&lt;/math&gt;). First case of notation (number of coefficients) is more recent and more frequented (e.g. D8 is wavelet with 8 coefficients).

== Example ==
[[MATLAB]] code for enumeration of wavelet with 4 coefficients (denoted as D4).
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
t = solve(
	'h0*h0 + h1*h1 + h2*h2 + h3*h3 = 1',           % normalization
	'h2*h0 + h3*h1 = 0',                           % orthogonality
	'+(0^0)*h0 -(1^0)*h1 +(2^0)*h2 -(3^0)*h3 = 0', % zero
	'+(0^1)*h0 -(1^1)*h1 +(2^1)*h2 -(3^1)*h3 = 0'  % and first vanishing moments
);
&lt;/source&gt;

Solutions (low pass filters only):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! h0 !! h1 !! h2 !! h3
 |-
 | -0.129409522551260 || 0.224143868042014 || 0.836516303737808 ||  0.482962913144534
 |-
 |  0.482962913144534 || 0.836516303737808 || 0.224143868042014 || -0.129409522551260

[[File:Manoderecha.svg|thumb|Prediction of direction of field (''B'') when the current ''I'' flows in the direction of the thumb]]
[[File:Right-hand grip rule.svg|thumb|The right-hand rule for motion produced with screw threads]]

The '''right-hand rule''' is a convention in [[vector]] math.  It helps you remember [[direction]] when vectors get [[vector math|cross multiplied]].

:# Start by closing your right hand and stick out your pointer finger.
:# Stick your [[thumb]] straight up like a your making the sign for a [[gun]].
:# If you point your &quot;gun&quot; straight ahead, stick out your middle finger so that it points left and all your fingers are at [[right angle|right angles]] to each other.

If you have two vectors that you want to cross multiply, you can figure out the direction of the vector that comes out by pointing your thumb in the direction of the first vector and your pointer in the direction of the second vector.  Your middle finger will point the direction of the cross product.

Remember that when you change the order that vectors get cross multiplied, the result goes in the opposite direction.  So it's important to make sure that you go in the order of &lt;math&gt;\vec{thumb} \times \vec{pointer} = \vec{middle}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variations==
There is another rule called the right-hand grip rule (or corkscrew rule) that is used for [[magnetism|magnetic fields]] and things that [[rotation|rotate]]. 
:# Start by putting your right hand out flat and point your thumb straight out so that it is at a [[right angle]] to your other [[fingers]].
:# Now curl your fingers into a [[fist]] and keep your [[thumb]] out (like a Thumbs Up).
:# Match how your fingers curl in to the way something is moving. The direction that your thumb is pointing is the direction of the vector we use to talk about it.

You can do this in reverse by starting your thumb in the direction of the vector and see how your fingers curl to see the direction of rotation. If you point your thumb in the direction of current in a wire, the magnetic field that comes up around it is in the direction of your curling fingers.

== A brief history ==
Starting, perhaps, with G. Udny Yule's paper in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yule, G.U. |year=1902 |title=Mendel's laws and their probable relations to intra-racial heredity |journal=New Phytologist |volume=1 |issue=9 |pages=193-207 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb06590.x |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb06590.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; population theorists tackled key issues in genetics and evolution. [[G.H. Hardy]] and [[Wilhelm Weinberg]] showed that if a population had random mating, no selection, migration or mutation, then the proportion of [[allele]]s would remain the same generation after generation. This was the [[Hardy–Weinberg law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Edwards, A.W.F. |year=2008 |title=G. H. Hardy (1908) and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium |journal=Genetics |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=1143-1150 |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/179/3/1143.short |doi=10.1534/genetics.104.92940}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first great result of this new field of research.

Population genetics made great progress from 1918 to 1937. During this period, [[Ronald Fisher]], [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and [[Sewall Wright]] worked on the connection between evolution and genetics, using new [[mathematics|mathematical]] techniques, such as [[statistics|statistical]] [[probability]]. [[E.B. Ford]] and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] did field research on the genetics of natural populations of [[lepidoptera]] and ''[[Drosophila]]'', respectively. Broadly speaking, this work proved that the newly rediscovered [[Mendelian genetics]] could be reconciled with Darwinian evolution. This laid the groundwork for the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]], which took place in the following years, from about 1937 to 1953.

In the second half of the 20th century, population geneticists tackled a range of complex evolutionary problems, such as the [[evolution of sex]], [[sexual selection]], [[kin selection]] (altruism), [[mimicry]] and molecular evolution. The key figures included [[John Maynard Smith]], [[Motoo Kimura]] and [[W.D. Hamilton|William Hamilton]]. Techniques developed for population genetics help to decide what contribution [[heredity]] and [[environment]] make in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;see also [[nature vs nurture]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface area of a [[polyhedron]] is found by finding the sum of the area of all of the faces. The surface area is found between many three-dimensional shapes using [[formula]]s.

The surface area is useful because it tells you how much material is required in order to cover the object—for example, how much [[paint]] is needed to paint a [[Table (furniture)|table]].Surface area is the sum of the faces, or surfaces, of a three dimensional shape.

In a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. For instance, to do an election poll, calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people only at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention. A page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting, so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected. But neither sample is really random because for one thing, some people do not have phones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4918">[[File:Exponential.svg|right|thumb|Three different functions: Linear (red), Cubic (blue) and '''Exponential''' (green).]]

In [[mathematics]], an '''exponential function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that quickly grows. More precisely, it is the function &lt;math&gt;\exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;, where e is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's constant]], an [[irrational number]] that is approximately 2.71828. 

==Properties==
Because exponential functions use exponentiation, they follow the same rules. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(x+y) = \exp(x)\exp(y) = e^{x+y}&lt;/math&gt;. This follows the rule that &lt;math&gt;x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[natural logarithm]] is the [[inverse operation]] of an exponential function.
:&lt;math&gt;\ln(x) = \log_{e}(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(e)}&lt;/math&gt;

This may also seem unintuitive because of a fundamental property in [[differential calculus]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x&lt;/math&gt;, not &lt;math&gt;xe^x&lt;/math&gt; as it would follow the general rule of thumb (see [[differentiation]])
This means that the slope of an exponential function is an exponential function itself, and subsequently this means it has a slope of 1 at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. These properties are the reason it is an important function in mathematics.

==Applications==
The exponential function is among the most useful of mathematical functions. It is used to represent [[exponential growth]], which has uses in virtually all [[science]] subjects and it is also prominent in [[Finance]].

== Examples ==

One example of an exponential function in real life would be interest in a bank. If a person deposits £100 into an account which gets 3% interest a month then the balance each month would be (assuming the money is untouched):
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Month
! Balance
! Month
! Balance
|-
| January
| £100.00
| July
| £119.41
|-
| February
| £103.00
| August
| £122.99
|-
| March
| £106.09
| September
| £126.68
|-
| April
| £109.27
| October
| £130.48
|-
| May
| £112.55
| November
| £134.39
|-
| June
| £115.93
| December
| £138.42
|}

Notice how the extra money from interest increases each month. The greater the original balance, the more interest the person will get.

== Relation to the mathematical constant ''e'' ==

{{complex|date=April 2012}}

Even though the base (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;) can be any number bigger than zero, for example, 10 or 1/2, often it is a special number called [[E (mathematical constant)|e]]. The number ''e'' cannot be written exactly, but it is almost equal to 2.71828.

The number ''e'' is important to every exponential function. For example, a bank pays interest of 0.01 percent every day. One person takes his interest money and puts it in a box. After 10,000 days (about 30 years), he has 2 times as much money as he started with. Another person takes his interest money and puts it back into the bank. Because the bank now pays him interest on his interest, the amount of money is an exponential function. After 10,000 days, he does not have 2 times as much money as he started with, but he has 2.718145 times as much money as he started with. This number is very close to the number ''e''. If the bank pays interest more often, so the amount paid each time is less, then the number will be closer to the number ''e''.

A person can also look at the picture to see why the number ''e'' is important for exponential functions. The picture has three different curves. The curve with the black points is an exponential function with a base a little smaller than ''e''. The curve with the short black lines is an exponential function with a base a little bigger than ''e''. The blue curve is an exponential function with a base exactly equal to ''e''. The red line is a [[Tangent (geometry)|tangent]] to the blue curve. It touches the blue curve at one point without crossing it. A person can see that the red curve crosses the ''x''-axis, the line that goes from left to right, at -1. This is true only for the blue curve. This is the reason that the exponential function with the base ''e'' is special.
[[File:Exp derivative at 0.svg|right|frame|''e'' is the unique number ''a'', such that the value of the derivative of the exponential function ''f'' (''x'') = ''a&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;'' (blue curve) at the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is exactly 1. For comparison, functions 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; (dotted curve) and 4&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; (dashed curve) are shown; they are not tangent to the line of slope 1 (red).]]

'''Graham's number''' is a very, very big [[natural number]] that was discovered by a man called Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called [[Ramsey theory]]. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.

Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a [[mathematical proof]]. Even if every digit in Graham's number was written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the universe.

==Context==

Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;Suppose we draw some number of points, and connect every pair of points by a line. Some lines are blue and some are red. Can we always find 3 points for which the 3 lines connecting them are all the same color?}}

It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or less, we can color the lines so that the answer is &quot;no&quot;.

Graham's number comes from a variation on this question.

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;Once again, say we have some points, but now they are the corners of an ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]]. They are still all connected by blue and red lines. For any 4 points, there are 6 lines connecting them. Can we find 4 points that all lie on one [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]], and the 6 lines connecting them are all the same color?}}

By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of ''n'' is the answer &quot;no&quot; (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of ''n'' is it &quot;yes&quot; (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet.

In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for ''n''=6, the answer is &quot;no&quot;. But when ''n'' is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is &quot;yes&quot;.

One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually &quot;yes&quot; for at least some large ''n''. Before 1971, we didn't know even that much.

==Definition==

Graham's number is not only too big to write down, it is too big even to express in [[scientific notation]]. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].

We will write down a [[sequence]] of numbers that we will call '''g1''', '''g2''', '''g3''', and so on. Each one will be used to define the next. When we get to '''g64''', that will be Graham's number.

First, here are some examples of up-arrows:

* 3x3x3 is &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow3&lt;/math&gt; is 27.
* &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt; is 7625597484987; you can think of this as &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow (3 \uparrow 3)&lt;/math&gt; which is 3 multiplied by itself &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow3&lt;/math&gt; times so 3x3x3x3x....x3x3, in total 27 times. 
* &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow 3)&lt;/math&gt; and this is &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow \uparrow 7625597484987&lt;/math&gt;; this number is so huge, its digits would fill up the universe and beyond. 
** Although this number may already be beyond comprehension, this is barely the start of this giant number.

The next step like this is &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow (3 \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3)&lt;/math&gt;. This is the number we will call '''g1'''.

After that, '''g2''' is equal to &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \ldots \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;; the number of arrows in this number is '''g1'''.

'''g3''' is equal to &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \ldots \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;, where the number of arrows is '''g2'''.

We keep going in this way. We stop when we define '''g64''' to be &lt;math&gt;3\uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \ldots \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow 3&lt;/math&gt;, where the number of arrows is '''g63'''.

This is Graham's number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1779">In [[mathematics]] a function is said to be '''continuous''' if, roughly said, a ''small change'' in the input only causes a ''small change'' in the output. If this is not the case, the function is said to be '''discontinuous'''.  Functions defined on the [[real number]]s, with one input and one output variable, will show as an ''uninterrupted line (or curve)''. They can be drawn ''without lifting the pen''. The definition given above was made by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Fischer
  | first = Helmut
  | coauthors = Helmut Kaul
  | title = Mathematik für Physiker Band 1: Grundkurs

  | series = Teubner Studienbücher Mathematik
  | page = 165 ff
  | year = 2007
  | isbn = 978-3-8351-0165-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Weierstraß]] gave another definition of continuity: Suppose that there is a function ''f'', defined on the [[real number]]s. At the point &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; the function will have the value &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;. If the function is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;, then for every value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; no matter how small it is, there is a value of &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, so that whenever &lt;math&gt;|x - x_0| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;, that makes &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(x_0)| &lt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively: Given a point close to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; (called x), the ''[[absolute value]]'' of the difference between the two values of the function can be made arbitrarily small, if the point x is ''close enough'' to &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

There are also special forms of continuous, such as ''Lipschitz-continuous''. A function is Lipschitz-continuous if there is a &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| \le L|x - y| &lt;/math&gt; for all x,y &amp;isin; (a,b).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1758">'''Decision theory''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[theory]] about how to best reach a [[decision]]. This is done using [[probability theory]], [[statistics]] and [[logic|logical reasoning]]. A decision can be made in different ways. Decision theory usually picks the best decision by looking at the consequences each way to decide might have. 

In most cases, decision theory is normative and prescriptive. Most of the time, it assumes the decision maker has ''perfect knowledge''. Decision makers know all the consequences, and case take the best pick. 

There are three branches of decision theory:
# '''Normative decision theory''': The decision makers take rational choices. There is also a [[set]] of [[axiom]]s that describe the decision process. This allows to reach a decision through the use of [[logic]]. This describes '''how''' to reach a decision.
# '''Prescriptive decision theory''': This tries to help people reach better decisions, through the use of [[model]]s to follow. Humans have only limited capabilities to reach a decision. This is taken into account. 
# '''Descriptive decision theory''' looks at the way decisions are taken in real life, and tries to improve the process. 


Decision theory can also be classified as follows:
# '''Choice under certainty''': The decision maker knows all possible alternatives, and can exactly say at what probability each occurs. The decision maker chooses the action that will result in the most desirable outcome.
# '''Choice under uncertainty''': There are several outcomes for each action, depending on the state of nature. The outcome corresponding to the chosen action are uncertain, but the probabilities associated with each outcome is known.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1422">In [[mathematics]], a '''Markov chain''', named after [[Andrey Markov]], is a [[wikt:discrete|discrete]] random process with the Markov property. A discrete random process means a system which can be in various states. The system also changes randomly in discrete [[wikt:stage|steps]]. It can be helpful to think of the system as evolving through discrete steps in time, although strictly speaking the &quot;step&quot; may have nothing to do with time.

An example of a Markov chain is the dietary habits of a creature who only eats grapes, cheese or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following (artificial) rules:
* It eats exactly once a day.
* If it ate cheese yesterday, it will eat lettuce or grapes today with equal probability for each, and zero chance of eating cheese.
* If it ate grapes yesterday, it will eat grapes today with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10 and lettuce with probability 5/10.
* Finally, if it ate lettuce yesterday, it won't eat it again today, but will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10.
This creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice depends on what it ate yesterday, not additionally on what it ate 2 or 3 (or 4, etc...) days ago. One statistical property one could calculate is the expected percentage of the time the creature will eat cheese over a long period.

'''Hyperplane arrangements''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies how smaller objects, called hyperplanes, can be arranged in a bigger object. This is related to other fields of mathematics like number theory, combinatorics, and topology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2973">A '''computer algebra system (CAS)''' is a large [[computer program]] that helps people with [[mathematics]] and [[algebra]].  It changes and moves around (manipulates) mathematical [[equation]]s and expressions containing [[number]]s and symbols called [[variable]]s. Variables can stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for, or can be replaced with any value. It always keeps the formula exactly the same mathematically as the original equation or expression, unless it is being transformed, by a transformation algorithm.

A CAS might be used for [[integral|integration]] or [[derivative (mathematics)|differentiation]] (and other [[calculus]] transformations), simplification of an expression (making it smaller and/or simpler), optimizing and finding the minimum and maximum values of results or variables, etc.  Most have the ability to [[Cartesian coordinate system|plot functions and expressions]] for visualization, which can be helpful and educational too.

==Symbolic capabilities==
Computer algebra systems can be special purpose, focusing on only a few types of symbolic math, to very large, general purpose programs that do almost everything (for example, the [[free software|free]] CAS Maxima,&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxima.sourceforge.net/ Maxima, a Computer Algebra System]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the oldest CAS that is still under development).  The results output by a good computer algebra system are often exact, simple, and generalized to work in all possible cases.  Computer programs do have [[software bug|bugs]], so important results should always be verified for correctness.

==Numeric capabilities==
Modern computer algebra systems often include extensive numeric capabilities for convenience and which fit together with its symbolic abilities.
Numeric domains supported often include [[real number|real]], [[complex number|complex]], [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], [[rational number|rational]], and algebraic numbers.

Usually [[Floating point unit|floating point]] arithmetic is available to use if desired, because the arithmetic is done by most [[computer hardware]] very quickly.  The down-side of floating point arithmetic is that it is not always exact, and is mostly useless for rocket science, because of only 14 decimal digits of accuracy (with double precision floats), and because of a growing [[rounding|round-off]] error with each calculation, sometimes even less digits are accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathomatic.org/math/notes.html#float Notes on the Limitations of Computer Algebra Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rational number arithmetic is exact if all numbers are rational.  Interval arithmetic can be used to easily calculate the total possible error of an inexact arithmetic system.  Complex number arithmetic is generally supported by allowing the [[imaginary unit]] (&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;) in expressions and following all of its algebraic [[rule]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1273">The '''commutative property''' of addition and multiplication tells us that it does not matter which number we add first, or multiply first. We will still get the same answer if we add them backwards. The same thing goes for multiplying backwards.

The definition of commutative property of addition is, when we substitute any number for ''a'' and ''b'', &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, &lt;math&gt;2+3=3+2&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;2+3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3+2&lt;/math&gt; are both &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. It doesn't matter whether the &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; or the &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; comes first. 2+3=3+2 is the same as &lt;math&gt;a+b=b+a&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;a=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=3&lt;/math&gt;.


We can substitute fractions too. &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Either way, it adds to &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.

And for good mathematicians, we can substitute [[irrational numbers]] as well: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{4}+\sqrt{8}=\sqrt{8}+\sqrt{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Some operations like dividing are not commutative. For instance, 6 divided by 3 is 2, but 3 divided by 6 is 1/2. Do not divide backwards. Dividing is not commutative. Subtracting is not commutative either. But in higher mathematics, there are other commutative operations besides adding and multiplying.

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = z^2&lt;/math&gt;
This equation is known as  the [[Diophantine equation]], and is related to [[Pythagoras' theorem]].
The lowest '''Pythagorean triple''' is [3, 4, 5] because:

The next highest triple is [5, 12, 13] then [7, 24, 25], and so on.
There is an [[infinite]] number of Pythagorean triples.

A Pythagorean Triple always consists of: 

•	all even numbers, or

•	two odd numbers and an even number.

A Pythagorean Triple can never be made up of all odd numbers or two even numbers and one odd number.

A '''Bayesian network''' is a kind of [[graph]] which is used to model events that cannot be observed. This can then be used for inference. The graph that is used is directed, and does not contain any cycles. The nodes of the graph represent [[random variable]]s. If two nodes are connected by an edge, it has an associated [[probability]] that it will transmit from one node to the other.

Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of  (unassisted) [[machine learning]]. They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and [[information retrieval]].

It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740's called [[Bayes' theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' p. 10.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term &quot;Bayesian networks&quot; was made by [[Judea Pearl]] in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Pearl |first=J.  |year=1985 |title=Bayesian Networks: A Model of Self-Activated Memory for Evidential Reasoning |conference=Proceedings of the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, University of California, Irvine, CA

#The often subjective nature of the input information.
#The reliance on Bayes's conditioning as the basis for updating information.
#The distinction between causal and evidential modes of reasoning, which underscores [[Thomas Bayes]]' posthumously published paper of 1763.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bayes |first=T. |authorlink=Thomas Bayes |year=1763 |title = An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances. |journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume = 53
 |pages = 370–418 |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1763.0053 |last2=Price |first2=Mr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980's the seminal texts ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems''&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, J., ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems'', Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems''&lt;ref&gt;Neapolitan, R.E., ''Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems'', Wiley, NY, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study.  

Informal variants of such networks were first used by [[legal scholar]] [[John Henry Wigmore]], in the form of [[Wigmore chart]]s, to analyse [[trial (law)|trial]] [[evidence (law)|evidence]] in 1913.&lt;ref name=kadane&gt;{{ cite book | author=J. B. Kadane and D. A. Schum | title=A Probabilistic Analysis of the Sacco and Vanzetti Evidence|location=New York|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-14182-8

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in social and behavioral sciences (mostly with linear parametric models).

'''Aleph null''' (or '''Aleph 0''') is the lowest [[infinite]] number.  It is the [[cardinality]] (size) of the set of [[natural numbers]] (there are aleph null natural numbers).  It is also sometimes called '''Aleph naught'''.

It is followed by [[Aleph one]].

The [[number]] '''four''' is a [[number]] and a [[numeral]]. It comes after the number [[3 (number)|three]], and before the number [[5 (number)|five]]. In [[Roman numerals]], it is '''IV'''.

== Mathematics ==
In [[mathematics]], the number four is an [[even number]] and the smallest [[composite number]]. Four is also the second [[square number]] after [[one]].
A small minority of people have four fingers and four toes, on each hand and foot, respectively.  This proves difficult to count on your fingers. Four squared is 16, and four doubled is 8.

[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|250px|A homotopy of a coffee cup into a donut ([[torus]]).]]
'''Homotopies''' are studied in a branch of [[mathematics]] known as [[Algebraic Topology]]. A homotopy is a [[wikt:deformation|deformation]] (change of [[form]]) of one thing into another without [[cutting]] it. For example, if we imagine a stretchy object, then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are &quot;[[Homotopy equivalence|homotopy equivalent]]&quot;. One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a [[coffee cup]] and a [[donut]]. To a [[topologist]], these two shapes are the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2106">In [[mathematics]], an '''interval''' is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end.  Numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval, and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval.  The beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval.  An example of an interval might be from 3.3 to 15.  Numbers such as 4, 8, 9.5, 14, and even 14.999 are inside this interval.  Numbers such as -4, 2, 3.2, 20, and 15.000001 are not inside this interval.

To write an interval, write either a square bracket ( '''[''' ) or a parenthesis ( '''(''' ), the beginning number, a comma ( ''',''' ), the end number, and either a closing square bracket ( ''']''' ) or a closing parenthesis ( ''')''' ).  Examples of intervals are '''(4, 9.6)''', '''[-100, 100]''', '''[-30, -4)'''.

== Different kinds of intervals ==

Intervals can be separated by how they act at their ends.  Intervals can be '''closed''', '''open''', or '''mixed'''.

=== Closed Intervals ===
An interval that is closed also includes the beginning and the end.  A closed interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include 3, 5.4, and every number between 3 and 5.4.  To write a closed interval, use square brackets ( '''[''' and ''']''' ).  An example of an closed interval is '''[136, 450]'''.

=== Open Intervals ===
An interval that is open does not include the beginning or the end.  An open interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include every number between 3 and 5.4, but it would not include 3 or 5.4.  To write an open interval, use parentheses ( '''(''' and ''')''' ).  An example of an open interval is '''(2, 5)'''.

=== Mixed Intervals ===
A mixed interval is open at one end and closed at the other end.  This means that the interval may include the beginning but not the end, or it may include the end but not the beginning.  The interval '''[9, 23)''' would include 9, but it would not include 23.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">[[File:999 Perspective.png|300px|right|0.999... in perspective.]]
'''0.999...''' is one of the ways [[1 (number)|the number 1]] can be written. Even though it is written like this, it is still the same as one.

==About==
0.999... is a [[Rational number#Repeating Decimals|repeating decimal]], which means the [[Numerical digit|digit]] &quot;9&quot; is repeated forever. It is different from 0.999, which only has three 9s.

0.999... can also be written as
&lt;math alt=&quot;0.9 with bar over the 9&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;top:-.35em&quot;&gt;0.\bar{9}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math alt=&quot;0.9 with dot over the 9&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;top:-.35em&quot;&gt;0.\dot{9}&lt;/math&gt; or
&lt;math alt=&quot;0.(9)&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;top:-.15em&quot;&gt;0.(9)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

It is hard for many people to understand why 0.999... is the same as 1. There are many [[mathematical proof|proofs]] that show why they are the same number, but many of these proofs are very complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=K. |last2=Katz |first2=M. |author2-link=Mikhail Katz |year=2010a |title=When is .999... less than 1? |journal=The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–30 |url=http://www.math.umt.edu/TMME/vol7no1/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
One simple way of showing that 0.999... and 1 are the same thing is to [[Division (mathematics)|divide]] them both by the [[3 (number)|number 3]]. When 0.999... is divided by 3, the answer is 0.333..., which is the same as {{Fraction|1|3}} (the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] one third).

:&lt;math&gt;{0.999\ldots \over 3} = 0.333\ldots = \frac 13&lt;/math&gt;

When 1 is divided by 3, the answer is {{Fraction|1|3}}. Since the answers are the same, that means that 0.999... and 1 are the same. Another way of thinking about it is if {{Fraction|1|3}} = 0.333... and {{Fraction|2|3}} = 0.666..., then {{Fraction|3|3}} = 0.999... = 1. There are many other ways of showing this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot; /&gt;

==In popular culture==

As the [[Internet]] developed, arguments about 0.999... are often on [[newsgroup]]s and [[message board]]s. Even newsgroups and message boards that do not have much to do with math argue about this. In the newsgroup &lt;tt&gt;sci.math&lt;/tt&gt;, arguing about 0.999... is a &quot;popular sport&quot;.&lt;ref name=sci.mathfaq/&gt; It is also one of the questions in its [[FAQ]].&lt;ref name=sci.mathfaq&gt;As observed by Richman (p. 396). {{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/sci-math-faq/specialnumbers/0.999eq1/ |author=Hans de Vreught | year=1994 | title=sci.math FAQ: Why is 0.9999... = 1? |accessdate=2006-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="610">In [[mathematics]], '''odds''' are the chance that an event will happen compared to the chance that it will not happen. For example, if there is an equal chance that it will rain or that it will not rain, the odds of it raining are 1:1 (which is read as &quot;1 to 1&quot;). If it is twice as likely that it will not rain, then the odds of it raining are 1:2 (read as &quot;1 to 2&quot;).

==Uses for odds==
Odds are often used in gambling, especially in [[horse racing]].

[http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/P/Planck+Time]&lt;/ref&gt; Planck time is roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−44&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.

One Planck time is the time it would take a photon travelling at the speed of light to cross a distance equal to one [[Planck length]].
 
It is figured out from the [[Planck constant]], which was first thought of by the [[physics|physicist]] [[Max Planck]] in 1900. This work by Planck asserts that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and their relation can be put in terms of familiar units such as the [[joule]] by using the [[proportionality constant]] Planck gave us. Heisenberg's original quantum theory was improved by his teacher and colleague [[Max Born]]. Born put Heisenberg's equation into a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form. Born immediately noticed that to calculate using these matrices one matrix had to be multiplied by another matrix. In matrix multiplication multiplying matrix P by matrix X gives a different result from the one obtained by multiplying matrix X by matrix P. He further noticed that the difference between the two matrices involves '''h''', the Planck proportionality constant. It shows that one can never pin down things like P (momentum) and X (location) exactly. It turns out that we cannot pin down a time any better than we can pin down a place or a momentum. We get closer and closer and then we reach the &quot;Planck time.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4132">In [[probability theory]] and applications, '''Bayes' theorem''' shows the relation between a '''[[conditional probability]]''' and its reverse form. For example, the probability of a [[hypothesis]] given some observed pieces of evidence and the probability of that evidence given the hypothesis. This theorem is after [[Thomas Bayes]] (pronounced {{IPA-en|ˈbeɪz|}} or &quot;bays&quot;) and often called '''Bayes' law''' or '''Bayes' rule'''.

== Formula ==

The equation used is:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* P(''A'') is the [[prior probability]] or [[marginal probability]] of ''A''. It is &quot;prior&quot; in the sense that it does not take into account any information about&amp;nbsp;''B''.
* P(''A''|''B'') is the [[conditional probability]] of ''A'', given ''B''. It is also called the [[posterior probability]] because it is derived from or depends upon the specified value of&amp;nbsp;''B''.
* P(''B''|''A'') is the conditional probability of ''B'' given ''A''. It is also called the [[Likelihood_function|likelihood]].
* P(''B'') is the prior or marginal probability of ''B'', and acts as a [[normalizing constant]]. 


== Example ==

A simple example is as follows: There is a 40% chance of it raining on Sunday. If it rains on Sunday, there is a 10% chance it will rain on Monday. If it didn't rain on Sunday, there's an 80% chance it will rain on Monday.

&quot;Raining on Sunday&quot; is event A, and &quot;Raining on Monday&quot; is event B.
* P(''A'') = 0.40 = Probability of Raining on Sunday.
* P(''A`'') = 0.60 = Probability of not raining on Sunday.
* P(''B|A'') = 0.10 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.
* P(''B`|A'') = 0.90 = Probability of it not raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.
* P(''B|A`'') = 0.80 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it did not rain on Sunday.
* P(''B`|A`'') = 0.20 = Probability of it not raining on Monday, if it did not rain on Sunday.

The first thing we'd normally calculate is the probability of it raining on Monday:
This would be the sum of the probability of &quot;Raining on Sunday and raining on Monday&quot; and &quot;Not raining on Sunday and raining on Monday&quot;
:&lt;math&gt; 0.40\times0.10 + 0.60\times0.80 = 0.52 = 52%&lt;/math&gt; chance

However, what if we said: &quot;It rained on Monday. What is the probability it rained on Sunday?&quot; That is where Bayes' theorem comes in. It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event, given the result of a later event.

The equation used is:

:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}.&lt;/math&gt;


In our case, &quot;Raining on Sunday&quot; is event A, and &quot;Raining on Monday&quot; is event B.
* P(''B|A'') = 0.10 = Probability of it raining on Monday, if it rained on Sunday.
* P(''A'') = 0.40 = Probability of Raining on Sunday.
* P(''B'') = 0.52 = Probability of Raining on Monday.

So, to calculate the probability it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}.&lt;/math&gt;
or:
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{0.10*0.40}{0.52} = .0769&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, if it rained on Monday, there's a 7.69% chance it rained on Sunday.

== Intuitive Explanation ==
To calculate the probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, we can take the following steps:
* We know that it rained on Monday. Therefore, the total probability is P(B).
* The probability it rained on Sunday is P(A).
* The probability it rained on Monday, given that it rained on Sunday is P(B|A).
* The probability of raining on Sunday AND raining Monday is P(A)*P(B|A).
* Therefore, the total probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, is the chance of it raining on Sunday and Monday divided by the total chance of it having rained on Monday.
Therefore
:&lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = \frac{P(B | A)\, P(A)}{P(B)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another way to see this, which shows where Bayes' theorem comes from, is to consider the probability P(AB) that it rains on both Sunday and Monday.  This can be calculated in two different ways, which give the same answer for P(AB):
:&lt;math&gt;P(A)\, P(B|A) = P(B)\, P(A|B)&lt;/math&gt;
Bayes' theorem is just another way to write that equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1103">'''Category theory''' is a type of [[mathematics]].  Category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are the same. For example, some ideas from [[topology]] and [[abstract algebra]] are similar. Ideas in category theory are written down in [[formulas]] or [[diagrams]]. Category theory can be used to make [[computer programs]] more secure or easy to write.

A category is a mathematical object. It can be drawn with dots and arrows. Each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot. There can be many dots, sometimes so many that you can not count them. An arrow is the abstract idea of a [[function]] and the dots are the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] of the function.

Composition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows.  If two arrows form an elbow shape, then they have a [[composition]] arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second. Composition obeys some [[axioms]], or equations.

Many ideas in [[abstract algebra]] are examples of categories or can be used to make categories.  Often, this makes the ideas seem more similar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1136">'''Strict weak ordering''' is a [[binary relation]] on a [[set]]. Such relations define a [[strict ordering]], but they contain several elements of the same type. An example might be the relation &quot;costs less than&quot;, or &quot;is cheaper than&quot;. For any two elements that are ''of different types'', the relation holds. On the other hand, there are some elements that cannot be ordered that way, because they are of the same type. An example for such a relation may be the relation, ''costs less than'': milk may ''cost less than'' bread, and bread may cost less than cake. Two items of different types may cost less than another, but they can otherwise have the same price.

Two different [[algorithm]]s that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters, but they will always give an ordering where the four-letter words come before the five-letter-words, and after the three-letter-words.

[[Time]] will give a strict weak ordering too; Events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen [[Simultaneity|at the same time]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''linear equation''' is a type of [[equation]]. In a linear equation, both [[term]]s have to be [[constant term|constant]]. A linear equation is the equation of a straight line. This type of equation is written in the form:
y = mx + b   OR   (y - y1) = m(x - x1)
WHERE
m = the rate of change, or slope. The slope is how fast the line moves up or down. Larger numbers will make the slope steeper. If m is a negative number, then the line will appear to fall or go down the page when read from left to right. If m is a positive number, then the line will appear to climb the page when read from left to right.
b = the y-intercept of the function. This is where the function crosses the y - axis of the coordinate plane.
The first equation is called '''slope-intercept form''', because in it, the slope (m) and y-intercept (b) are easily found.
The second equation is called '''point-slope form''', because in it, a point on the graph (x1, y1) and the slope (m) are easily found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="919">The '''pigeonhole principle''' explains that when there are (n) pigeon-sized holes in a [[pigeon]] container, then it's impossible to fit more than (n) pigeons in that container, without having at least one hole containing more than one. The pigeons are used here as an example for anything that can be put into containers or subdivisions.

This [[theorem]] is important in [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], especially in [[graph theory]].

==Example==

In one suitcase there are 12 blue socks and 18 black socks. If we close our eyes, how many socks must we pull out to be sure we have a pair the same color?

If we think of the colors as 'holes' or categories, we have 2 holes, so (n) = 2. If we pull three socks from the suitcase, at least two of them must be the same color, because 3 is a number greater than 2.  So the correct answer here is three.

[[File:Banach-Tarski Paradox.svg|thumb]]
'''Banach–Tarski paradox''' is a [[theorem]] in [[mathematics]] that says that any solid shape can be reassembled into any other solid shape. For example, a sphere can be split up into a limited number of parts which can then be put back together again to make two identical copies of the original sphere. The Banach-Tarski paradox can also be used to turn a small sphere into a huge sphere. It is important when thinking about this to realize that the parts that the solid shape is being split into are not solid shapes themselves; they are [[infinite]] sets of points spread around the solid shape. For the Banach-Tarski paradox to work, you need to use the [[axiom of choice]].

The reason this is called a paradox is because no stretching or bending of the parts takes place and no new material is added yet by the end the volume can be doubled. This goes against our geometric intuition. However, it is mathematically possible and it turns out that in this case our intuition is not correct.

{{General relativity}}

The '''Einstein field equations''', or '''Einstein-Hilbert equations''', or simply '''Einstein equations''' are [[equation]]s that describe [[gravity]] in the classical sense. They are named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[David Hilbert]]. The basic idea is to use [[geometry]] to model the effects of gravity. The usual form of the equations is that of nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s. Such equations are usually solved by [[approximation]]. An exact solution can be obtained in special cases, where certain assumptions are dropped, or simplified.

== Mathematical Interpretation ==
Einstein used mathematical objects called ''tensors'' to describe the curvature of [[spacetime]] to define [[gravity]]. The equation below is the general form of the EFE:

&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}-{1 \over 2}g_{\mu\nu},R+g_{\mu\nu}\Lambda={8\pi G \over c^4}T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where R&lt;sub&gt;μv&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the ''Ricci curvature tensor'', g&lt;sub&gt;μv&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''metric tensor'', ''R'' is the scalar curvature, Λ is the ''cosmological constant'', ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], [[π]] is [[pi]], [[c]] is the [[speed of light]], and T&lt;sub&gt;μv&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ''stress-energy tensor''.

'''Charge conjugation''' describes a type of [[symmetry]] of nature.  To preform a charge conjugation, one would exchange all [[particles]] with their corresponding [[antiparticles]].  This action would create a physical system where everything would be the same except the [[electromagnetic charge]] would be reversed.  For example, one could make an anti[[hydrogen atom]] with an anti[[proton]] and an anti[[electron]].  This would result in an [[atom]] with a negatively charged [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] orbited by a positively charged [[positron]].  The masses of the nucleus and the [[lepton]] orbiting the nucleus would remain unchanged.  If the behavior of the system (such as the atom mentioned above) remains unchanged after charge conjugation, the system is said to be symmetric with respect to charge conjugation.  This symmetry is also known as &quot;C symmetry.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5931">A '''heuristic''' is a practical way to solve a [[problem]]. It is better than [[chance]], but does not always work. A person develops a heuristic by using [[intelligence]], [[experience]], and [[common sense]]. [[Trial and error]] is the simplest heuristic, but one of the weakest. '''Rule of thumb''' and 'educated guesses' are other names for simple heuristics. Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result, there are always exceptions.

Sometimes heuristics are rather vague: 'look before you leap' is a guide to behaviour, but 'think about the consequences' is a bit clearer. Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages. When doctors examines a patient, they go through a whole set of tests and observations. They may not find out what is wrong, but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding. This is called a [[diagnosis]].

In [[computer science]], a 'heuristic' is a kind of [[algorithm]]. Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem. A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions, but there is no [[guarantee]] or [[Mathematical proof|proof]] that the solutions are correct. The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration.

== Background ==
Heuristics is the [[art]] of finding an adequate solution to a problem, using limited knowledge and little time.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gigerenzer G. &amp; Todd P.M. 1999. ''Simple heuristics that make us smart''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More formally, heuristics are based on experience; they can speed up the search for a solution using simple rules. A complete search may take too long, or may be too difficult to do. 

In more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control [[problem solving]] in human beings and machines.&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, Judea 1983.  ''Heuristics: intelligent search strategies for computer problem solving''. New York, Addison-Wesley, vii. ISBN 978-0201055948&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuristics can be used in some fields of science, but not in others: For economics, a solution that is one percent off is often acceptable; a [[telescope]] that has an error of one degree is probably unusable if aimed at a far-away object. The same telescope pointed to the window across the street will probably tolerate this error; missing by one degree will not have a big impact on a short distance. 

Heuristics can be used to estimate an answer which is then made more clear by performing an exact solution at a very small scale, perhaps to save time, money or labor on a project - for example a heuristic guess as to how much weight a bridge is expected to carry can be used to determine whether the bridge should be made of wood, stone or steel, and appropriate quantities of the needed material can be purchased while the exact design of the bridge is being completed.

However, the use of heuristics in certain very technical fields may be damaging {{ndash}} computer science is one example.  Programming a computer to perform more or less the desired actions may result in severe glitches. Therefore computer tasks generally must be fairly exact.  However, there are certain areas in which computers can calculate heuristic solutions safely {{ndash}} for example Google's search technology relies heavily on heuristics, producing &quot;near-miss&quot; matches to a search query when an exact match cannot be found. This enables a user to correct for any mistakes the search produces. Example: Searching for the name &quot;Peter Smith&quot; and unable to find that exact name, the search engine heuristically matches &quot;Pete Smith&quot; instead, and the person using the search engine must decide whether Pete and Peter are the same person.

== Examples ==
=== Polya ===
Here are some other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, ''How to Solve It'':&lt;ref&gt;Polya, George 1945. ''How To Solve It: a new aspect of mathematical method''. Princeton, N.J; Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-02356-5  ISBN 0-691-08097-6&lt;/ref&gt;
*If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try drawing a picture.
*If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that (&quot;working backward&quot;).
*If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.
*Try solving a more general problem first: the &quot;[[inventor]]'s [[paradox]]&quot;: the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success.

=== Packing problem ===
[[Image:Knapsack.svg|thumb|right|250px|Example of a packing problem. This is a one-dimensional (constraint) [[Knapsack problem]]: which boxes should be chosen to maximize the amount of money and keep the overall weight under 15&amp;nbsp;kg? A multi dimensional problem could consider the density or dimensions of the boxes, the latter a typical [[packing problem]].&lt;br /&gt;
(The solution in this case is to choose all of the boxes besides the green one.)]]

One example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem. The problem consists of packing a number of items. There are rules that need to be respected. For example, each item has a value and a weight. The problem now is to get the most valuable items, with the least weight possible. Another instance is fitting a number of differently-sized items into a confined space, like the trunk of a car.

To get the perfect solution to the problem, all possibilities must be tried. This is often not a good option, as trying them takes a long time, and on average, half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found. So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item, fit it in, and then try to arrange the other items around it. This will give a good solution, most of the time. There are cases however, where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used. 

Therefore, this is a heuristic solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1666">'''n factorial''' (written '''n!''') is the [[number]] we get when we multiply every number from 1 to ''n''. If ''n'' is 0, n factorial is 1. ''n''! is not defined for [[negative number]]s.  However, the related [[gamma function]] is defined over the [[real numbers|real]] and [[complex numbers|complex]] numbers (but the integers it is defined over are positive).

It is used to find out how many possible ways there are to arrange n objects.

For example, if there are 3 letters (A, B, and C), they can be arranged as ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA. That's 6 choices because A can be put in 3 different places, B has 2 choices left after A is placed, and C has only one choice left after A and B have been placed. That is 3×2×1 = 6 choices.

More generally, if there are three objects, and we want to find out how many different ways there are to arrange (or select them), for the first object, there are 3 choices, for the second object, there are only two choices left as the first object has already been chosen, and finally, for the third object, there is only one position left.

Therefore 3! is equivalent to 3×2×1, or 6.

This function is a good example of [[recursion]] (doing things over and over), as 3! can be written as 3×(2!), which can be written as 3×2×(1!) and finally 3×2×1×(0!). N! can therefore also be defined as N×(N-1)! with 0! = 1.

The factorial function grows very fast. There are 3,628,800 ways to arrange 10 items.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="823">The '''Entscheidungsproblem''' (German, &quot;decision problem&quot;) is a famous [[problem]] of [[mathematics]]. [[David Hilbert]] formulated the problem in 1928: Is there an [[algorithm]] that will take a [[formal language]], and a logical statement in that language, and that will output &quot;True&quot; or &quot;False&quot;, depending on the truth value of the statement? The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer, nor prove it, as long as the answer is always correct.

In 1936 and 1937, [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in [[arithmetic]] are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem.

      <comment>Robot: Removing [[fr:Précision]] (strong connection between (2) [[simple:Arithmetic precision]] and [[fr:Précision arithmétique]])</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2825">The '''precision''' of a [[number|numeric]] value describes the number of [[numerical digit|digit]]s that are used to show that value.  In a scientific setting, this would be the ''total'' number of digits (sometimes called the ''significant figures'' or ''[[significant digits]]'') or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or '''decimal places''' (the number of digits following the [[decimal point]]).  This second definition is useful in [[finance|financial]] and [[engineering]] applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.

In both cases, the term &quot;precision&quot; can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be [[rounding|rounded]].  For example, in [[floating point]] arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand.  In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the [[decimal separator]] for many world [[currency|currencies]]).

As an [[example]], the [[decimal]] quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.  If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision.  The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the [[Rounding#Round half to even|round-to-even method]].

{| cellpadding=8 border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot; &lt;!--
        --&gt; style=&quot;margin-left:5em;&quot;&gt;
|-
!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Precision

|align=center|12.3
|-

|align=center|n/a
|align=center|12
|}

Note that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured. For instance, if a device measures to the nearest [[gram]] and gives a reading of 12.345&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]], it would create ''false precision'' if the measurement were expressed &quot;12.34500&amp;nbsp;kg&quot; with 2 extra zeroes (&quot;00&quot;) at the end.

The representation of a positive number ''x'' to a precision of ''p'' significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula
:[[Rounding|round]](10&lt;sup&gt;''−n''&lt;/sup&gt;·''x'')·10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' = floor([[logarithm|log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] ''x'') + 1 − ''p''.
For a negative number, the numerical value is minus that of the [[absolute value]].
The number 0, to any precision, can be taken to be 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1863">In [[mathematics]], the [[word]] &quot;'''proportions'''&quot; means 2 [[ratio]]s put into an [[equation]]. Some examples of proportions are:
:* {{convert/numdisp|50/100}} = {{convert/numdisp|1/2}}
:* {{convert/numdisp|75/100}} = {{convert/numdisp|3/4}}
:* {{convert/numdisp/frac1|||x|100}} = {{convert/numdisp|3/4}}, where x = 75.
In [[algebra]], proportions can be used to solve many common problems about changing [[number]]s. As an example, for the increase in a $40 purchase of [[gasoline]] ([[petrol]]), if the price rose 35 cents, from $3.50 to $3.85, the proportion would be:
:* {{convert/numdisp/frac1|||x|3.85}} = {{convert/numdisp/frac1|||$40|3.50}}
The solution is simply:
:* x = $40/3.50 x 3.85 &amp;nbsp; = &amp;nbsp; $44.00, or $4 more when $0.35 higher.
Many other common calculations can be solved by using proportions to show the relationships between the numbers.

==Proportionality constant==
A '''Proportionality constant''' is a number that is used to convert a measurement in one system to the equivalent measurement in another system. For instance, people who are familiar with the traditional system of units used in the United States, pounds, feet, inches, etc., may need to find out the metric equivalent for these measures in grams and meters. To make these calculations they would need some proportionality constants.

One way to write a formula showing how to use a proportionality constant (let us call it &quot;K&quot;) is:

X*K = Y

For instance, people may know that they have 100 eggs and want to know how many dozen eggs they have. The proportionality constant K is then 1 dozen/ 12 eggs.

100 eggs * 1 dozen / 12 eggs = 8 dozen eggs + 4 eggs.

Examples of proportionality constants:

[[Planck constant]] -- puts the energy of a photon of a given frequency into a commonly used unit of energy, the [[Joule]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">'''Binary adders''' are devices used to [[addition|add]] [[binary numeral system|binary number]]s. They are used in [[computer]]s. They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a [[sum]]. In its most basic form, it uses two [[XOR gate]]s, two [[AND gate]]s, and an [[OR gate]]. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. 

When solving this example 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fifth digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">In formal [[number theory]] a '''Gödel numbering''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which assigns to each symbol and formula of some [[formal language]] a unique [[natural number]] called a '''Gödel number (GN)'''. The concept was first used by [[Kurt Gödel]] for the proof of his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]]. 

A Gödel numbering can be interpreted as an [[encoding]] where a number is assigned to each [[symbol]] of a [[mathematical notation]], and a stream of [[natural number]]s can then represent some form or function. A [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] of the set of [[computable function]]s can then be represented by a stream of Gödel numbers (also called effective numbers). [[Rogers' equivalence theorem]] states   criteria for which those numberings of the set of computable functions  are Gödel numberings. 

==Definition==

Given a [[countable set]] ''S'', a '''Gödel numbering''' is an [[injective function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f:S \to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
with both ''f'' and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[inverse function|inverse]] of ''f'') being [[computable function]]s.

==Examples==
===Base notation and strings===
One of the simplest Gödel numbering schemes is used every day: The correspondence between integers and their representations as strings of symbols. For example, the sequence '''2 3''' is understood, by a particular set of rules, to correspond to the number twenty-three. Similarly, strings of symbols from some alphabet of ''N'' symbols can be encoded by identifying each symbol with a number from 0 to ''N'' and reading the string as the [[base (mathematics)|base]] ''N''+1 representation of an integer.

&lt;!---

===Gödel's encoding===
The numbering system used in [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] encodes arbitrary sequences of any positive integers, which allowed Gödel to encode not just strings of symbols, but sequences of strings as well. Given a sequence &lt;math&gt;x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n&lt;/math&gt; of positive integers, the Gödel encoding is the product of the first n primes raised to their corresponding values in the sequence:

&lt;math&gt;\rm{enc}(x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n) = 2^{x_1}\cdot 3^{x_2}\cdot 5^{x_3}\cdot ...\cdot {p_n}^{x_n}&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], any code obtained this way can be uniquely factored into prime factors, so it is possible to recover the original sequence.
See also a more sophisticated (but more “concise”) way to construct  [[Gödel numbering for sequences]].

Gödel specifically used this scheme at two levels: first, to encode sequences of symbols representing formulas, and second, to encode sequences of formulas representing proofs. This allowed him to show a correspondence between statements about natural numbers and statements about the provability of theorems about natural numbers, the key observation of the proof.

==Discussion==
This Gödel numbering is not unique.  The general idea is to map formulas onto natural numbers.  An alternative Gödel numbering could be to consider each of the symbols of Step 1 to be mapped (through, say, a mapping ''h'') to a digit of a [[Radix|base]]-22 [[numeral system]], so a formula  consisting of a string of ''n'' symbols &lt;math&gt; s_1 s_2 s_3 \dots s_n&lt;/math&gt; would be mapped to the number

:&lt;math&gt; h(s_1) \times 22^{(n-1)} + h(s_2) \times 22^{(n-2)} + \cdots + h(s_{n-1}) \times 22^1 + h(s_n) \times 
22^0. &lt;/math&gt;

Also, Gödel numbering implies that each [[rule of inference|inference rule]] of the formal system can be expressed as a function of natural numbers.  If ''f'' is the Gödel mapping and if formula ''C'' can be derived from formulas ''A'' and ''B'' through an inference rule ''r'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt; A, B \vdash_r C, \ &lt;/math&gt;

then there should be some arithmetical function ''g&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' of natural numbers such that
:&lt;math&gt; g_r(f(A),h(B)) = f(C). \ &lt;/math&gt;
Then, since the formal system is a formal arithmetic, which can make statements about numbers and their arithmetical relationships to each other, it follows that the system can also, by means of Gödel coding, indirectly make statements about itself: that is, a proposition of the formal system can make assertions which, when viewed through the perspective of the Gödel mapping, translate into assertions about other propositions of the same formal system, or even about itself.  Thus, by this means a formal arithmetic can make assertions about itself, becoming [[self-reference|self-referential]], almost like a [[second-order logic]].  This provided Gödel (and other logicians) with a means of exploring and discovering proofs about consistency and completeness properties of formal systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">'''Gödel's incompleteness theorems''' is the name given to two [[theorem]]s, proved by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1931. They are theorems in [[mathematical logic]].

In a formal system, there are [[axiom]]s. All axioms are assumed to be true, at any rate for the purpose of the logic. A theorem then comes up with ''other true statements from the axioms'', using certain rules. A sequence of such statements is called a ''proof'' of a statement, because it shows that the statement is true, given the axioms. 

Ideally, it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner. A system that has this property is called ''complete''; one that does not is called ''incomplete''. Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions. This means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time. A system that does not include theories that allow this is called ''consistent''.

Gödel said that ''every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent'': &lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Ernest; Newman, James Roy &amp; Hofstadter, Douglas [1958] 2002. ''Gödel's proof'', revised ed. ISBN 0-8147-5816-9  [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2002i:03001]
&lt;/ref&gt;
#For a given (non-trivial) formal system, there will be statements that are true in that system, but which cannot be proved to be true inside the system. 
#If a system can be proved to be complete using its own logic, then there will be a theorem in the system that is contradictory.

Most people think this shows that [[David Hilbert|Hilbert's]] program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of [[mathematics]] is impossible. This would  give a negative answer to [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's second problem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1190">The '''structured program theorem''' is a [[theory]] in [[programming language|programming]] and [[computer science]]. A computer program can be split into pieces of [[source code|code]] that do a certain [[task]]. According to the structured program theory, these smaller tasks can be combined in only three ways to get any larger task done.

A program gets a large task done by splitting it into many smaller tasks that the computer can do easily. These smaller tasks are called ''subprograms'' in computer science. According to the structured program theorem, the three ways subprograms can be combined are:
# ''In sequence.'' Executing (running) one subprogram, and then executing another subprogram.
# ''By selection.'' Executing a subprogram based on a certain condition.
# ''In repetition.'' Executing the same subprogram over and over again.
The theorem was first published in 1966 by [[Corrado Böhm]] and [[Guiseppe Jacopini]]. It comes from the 1946 description of the [[von Neumann architecture]] and the [[normal form theorem]] developed by [[Stephen Kleene]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="631">A '''Complexity class''' is a concept from [[theoretical computer science]] and [[mathematics]]: All problems that have the same [[complexity theory|complexity]] are in the same complexity class. This means, that for a given input, they need about the same amount of resources, such as compute time, or memory. The most often used models for complexity are [[time complexity]], which measures the time needed to calculate a result, or space complexity, which looks at the amount of memory or storage needed. When talking about complexity classes, a ''worst case scenario'' is usually assumed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47140">The word &quot;'''rounding'''&quot; for a [[number|numerical]] value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit form. For example, US$23.74 could be rounded to US$24, or the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3, or the [[expression]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; as 1.41.

Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the [[accuracy]] of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as &quot;about 123,500&quot;.

On the other hand, rounding can introduce some ''round-off error'' in the result.  Rounding is almost unavoidable in many [[computation]]s, especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[floating point]] representation with a fixed number of significant digits.  In a [[sequence]] of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain &quot;ill-conditioned&quot; cases, then they may make the result meaningless.

Accurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as &quot;[[#The table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]&quot; (''below'').

Rounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[digital signal]]s.

== Types of rounding ==

Typical rounding problems are:
* approximating an [[irrational number]] by a fraction, e.g. [[Pi (mathematical constant)|π]] by 22/7;
* approximating a fraction with periodic decimal expansion by a finite decimal fraction, e.g. 5/3 by 1.6667;
* replacing a [[rational number]] by a fraction with smaller numerator and denominator, e.g. 3122/9417 by 1/3;
* replacing a fractional [[decimal number]] by one with fewer digits, e.g. 2.1784 dollars by 2.18 dollars;
* replacing a decimal [[integer]] by an integer with more trailing zeros, e.g. 23,217 people by 23,200 people; or, in general,
* replacing a value by a multiple of a specified amount, e.g. 27.2 seconds by 30 seconds (a multiple of 15).

== Rounding to a specified increment ==
The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc..

In general, rounding a number ''x'' to a multiple of some specified increment ''m'' entails the following steps:

#Divide ''x'' by ''m'', let the result be ''y'';
#Round ''y'' to an integer value, call it ''q'';
#Multiply ''q'' by ''m'' to obtain the rounded value ''z''.
:: &lt;math&gt;z = \mathrm{round}(x, m) = \mathrm{round}(x / m) \cdot m\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, rounding ''x'' = 2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing ''y'' = ''x''/''m'' = 2.1784/0.01 = 217.84, then rounding ''y'' to the integer ''q'' = 218, and finally computing ''z'' = ''q''×''m'' = 218×0.01 = 2.18.

When rounding to a predetermined number of [[significant digits]], the increment ''m'' depends on the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).

The increment ''m'' is normally a finite fraction in whatever [[numeral system]] that is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal|decimal numeral system]] (that is, ''m'' is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary numeral system]] (''m'' is an integer times a power of 2).

The abstract single-argument &quot;round()&quot; function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument &quot;round()&quot; function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value ''m'' = 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.

== Rounding to integer ==
The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single-argument &quot;round()&quot; function presented and used in the previous sections.

There are many ways of rounding a number ''y'' to an integer ''q''.  The most common ones are
* '''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''):  ''q'' is the largest integer that does not exceed ''y''.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{floor}(y) = \left\lfloor y \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -y \right\rceil\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''',  or '''round towards plus infinity'''):  ''q'' is the smallest integer that is not less than ''y''.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{ceil}(y) = \left\lceil y \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -y \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): ''q'' is the integer part of ''y'', without its fraction digits.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathrm{truncate}(y) = \sgn(y) \left\lfloor \left| y \right| \right\rfloor = -\sgn(y) \left\lceil -\left| y \right| \right\rceil\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if ''y'' is an integer, ''q'' is ''y''; else ''q'' is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that ''y'' is between 0 and ''q''.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \sgn(y) \left\lceil \left| y \right| \right\rceil = -\sgn(y) \left\lfloor -\left| y \right| \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;
* '''round to nearest''': ''q'' is the integer that is closest to ''y'' (see below for tie-breaking rules).

The first four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number ''y'' to the rounded value ''q'' are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[Extended real number line|+∞]], or −∞).

If ''y'' is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If ''y'' is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if ''y'' is integer, ''q'' is just ''y''. The following table illustrates these rounding methods:

Where many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000, and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author=Nicholas J. Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0898715217|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tie-breaking ==
Rounding a number ''y'' to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when ''y'' is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of ''y'' is exactly 0.5.

=== Round half up ===
The following  tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards plus infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values ''y'' are always rounded up.  

* If the fraction of ''y'' is exactly 0.5, then ''q'' = ''y'' + 0.5.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \left\lfloor y + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\left\lceil -y - 0.5 \right\rceil\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.

This is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

If it were not for the 0.5 fractions, the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down, by the same amount. When rounding a large set of numbers with [[random]] fractional parts, these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other, and the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers.

However, the ''round half up'' tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded up. This asymmetry introduces a positive [[bias]] in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of ''y'' consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of ''q'' will be 0.0005 higher than the expected value of ''y''. For this reason, round-to-nearest with the ''round half up'' rule is also (ambiguously) known as '''asymmetric rounding'''.

One reason for rounding up at 0.5 is that only one digit need be examined. When seeing 17.50000..., for example, the first three figures, 17.5, determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18. If the opposite rule were used (round half down), then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 17.5.

=== Round half down ===
One may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards minus infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up'' (the ''round half up'' method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).

* If the fraction of ''y'' is exactly 0.5, then ''q'' = ''y'' − 0.5.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \left\lceil y - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\left\lfloor -y + 0.5 \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

The ''round half down'' tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded down. This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of ''y'' consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of ''q'' will be 0.0005 lower than the expected value of ''y''. For this reason, round-to-nearest with the ''round half down'' rule is also (ambiguously) known as '''asymmetric rounding'''.

=== Round half away from zero ===
The other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:

* If the fraction of ''y'' is exactly 0.5, then ''q'' = ''y'' + 0.5 if ''y'' is positive, and ''q'' = ''y'' − 0.5 if ''y'' is negative.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \sgn(y) \left\lfloor \left| y \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor = -\sgn(y) \left\lceil -\left| y \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil \,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers, and a negative bias for the negative ones.

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).

=== Round half towards zero ===
One may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half away from zero'' (the ''round half away from zero'' method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).

* If the fraction of ''y'' is exactly 0.5, then ''q'' = ''y'' − 0.5 if ''y'' is positive, and ''q'' = ''y'' + 0.5 if ''y'' is negative.
*: &lt;math&gt;q = \sgn(y) \left\lceil \left| y \right| - 0.5 \right\rceil = -\sgn(y) \left\lfloor -\left| y \right| + 0.5 \right\rfloor \,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5  gets rounded to −23.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers, and a positive bias for the negative ones.

=== Round half to even ===
A tie-breaking rule that is even less biased is '''round half to even''', namely

* If the fraction of ''y'' is 0.5, then ''q'' is the ''even'' integer nearest to ''y''.

Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, +22.5 becomes +22, −22.5 becomes −22, and −23.5 becomes −24.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of ''y'' values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.

This variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''unbiased rounding''' (ambiguously, and a bit abusively), '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', or '''bankers' rounding'''. This is widely used in bookkeeping.

This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.

=== Round half to odd ===
Another tie-breaking rule that is very similar to '''round half to even''', namely

* If the fraction of ''y'' is 0.5, then ''q'' is the ''odd'' integer nearest to ''y''.

Thus, for example, +22.5 becomes +23, +21.5 becomes +21, −21.5 becomes −21, and −22.5 becomes −23.

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of ''y'' values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers (including zero), and a positive bias for the odd ones.

This variant is almost never used in most computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or −0.5 to zero, or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point (with limited ranges for the scaling exponent), so that a non ''infinite'' number would round to infinite, or that a small ''denormal'' value would round to a normal non-zero value (these could occur with the ''round half to even'' mode). Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out of range results when possible.

=== Stochastic rounding ===
Another unbiased tie-breaking method is '''stochastic rounding''':

* If the fractional part of ''y'' is .5, choose ''q'' randomly among ''y'' + 0.5 and ''y'' − 0.5, with equal probability.

Like round-half-to-even, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd ''q'' values. On the other hand, it introduces a random component into the result; performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results. Also, it is open to [[unconscious]] [[bias]] if humans (rather than computers or devices of chance) are &quot;[[random]]ly&quot; deciding in which direction to round.

=== Alternating tie-breaking ===
One method, more obscure than most, is '''round half alternatingly'''.

* If the fractional part is 0.5, alternate round up and round down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; so on so forth.

This suppresses the random component of the result, if occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts can be effectively numbered. But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence, if the total number of occurrences is odd.

==Simple dithering==
In some contexts, all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory. For example, suppose that ''y'' is an accurate measurement of an audio signal, which is being rounded to an integer ''q'' in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs. If ''y'' changes slowly with time, any of the rounding method above will result in ''q'' being completely constant for long intervals, separated by sudden jumps of ±1. When the ''q'' signal is played back, these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise, and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost.  

One way to avoid this problem is to round each value ''y'' upwards with probability equal to its fraction, and round it downwards with the complement of that probability. For example, the number 23.17 would be rounded up to 24 with probability 0.17, and down to 23 with probability 1 - 0.17 = 0.83. (This is equivalent to rounding down ''y'' + ''s'', where ''s'' is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.) With this special rounding, known as [[dithering]], the sudden steps get replaced by a less objectionable noise, and even small variations in the original signal will be preserved to some extent.  Like the stochastic approach to tie-breaking, dithering has no bias: if all fraction values are equally likely, rounding up by a certain amount is as likely as rounding down by that same amount; and the same is true for the sum of several rounded numbers. On the other hand, dithering introduces a random component in the result, much greater than that of stochastic tie-breaking.

More precisely, the roundoff error for each dithered number will be a [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] [[random variable]] with mean value of zero, but with a [[standard deviation]] &lt;math&gt;1 / \sqrt{12} \approx 0.2886&lt;/math&gt;, which is better than the 1/2 standard deviation with the simple predictive methods, but slightly higher than with the simpler stochastic method. However, the sum of ''n'' rounded numbers will be a random variable with expected error zero, but with standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} / \sqrt{12}&lt;/math&gt; (the total remaining noise) which diverges semi-quadratically and may become easily perceptible, even if the standard deviation of the roundoff error per sample will be &lt;math&gt;1 / \sqrt{12 n}&lt;/math&gt; which slowly converges semi-quadratically to zero. So, this random distribution may still be too high for some applications that are rounding a lot of data.

==Multidimensional dithering==
This variant of the simple dithering method still rounds values with [[probability]] equal to its [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. However, instead of using a random distribution for rounding isolated samples, the roundoff error occurring at each rounded sample is totalled for the next surrounding elements to sample or compute; this accumulated value is then added to the value of these next sampled or computed values to round, so that the modified values will take into account this difference using a predictive model (such as Floyd–Steinberg dithering).

The modified values are then rounded with any one of the above rounding methods, the best ones being with [[stochastic]] or dithering methods: in this last case, the sum of ''n'' rounded numbers will still be a random variable with expected error zero but with an excellent constant standard deviation of &lt;math&gt;1 / \sqrt{12}&lt;/math&gt;, instead of diverging semi-quadratically when dithering isolated samples; and the overall average roundoff error deviation per rounded sample will be &lt;math&gt;1 / (n \sqrt{12})&lt;/math&gt; that will converge [[hyperbolic]]ally to zero, faster than with the semi-hyperbolic convergence when dithering isolated samples.

In practice, when rounding large sets of sampled data (such as audio, image and video rendering), the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values (such as rounding towards zero), because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error [[bias]] and of its [[standard deviation]]. This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing (notably for accurate rescaling and [[antialiasing]] operations, where the simple probabilistic dithering of isolated values may still produce perceptible noise, sometimes even worse than the [[Moiré pattern|moiré effects]] occurring with simple non-probabilistic rounding methods applied to isolated samples).

The effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round: when sampling bidimensional images, including colored images (that add the discrete dimension of color planes), or tridimensional videos (that add a discrete time dimension), or on polyphonic audio data (using time and channel discrete dimensions), it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction, or equally into several orthogonal dimensions, such as vertically vs. horizontally for bidimensional images, or into parallel color channels at the same position and/or timestamp, and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions (according to a perception model). In those cases, several roundoff error accumulators may be used (at least one for each discrete dimension), or a (''n''-1)-dimension vector (or matrix) of accumulators.

In some of these cases, the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally: for example, when working with colored images, the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension (height, width and optionally time) could be remapped using a perceptive color model, so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation, instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently; and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels (left and right) may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors, in a balanced way around zero.

==Rounding to simple fractions==
In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number ''x'' to a &quot;neat&quot; fraction — that is, the nearest fraction ''z'' = ''m''/''n''
whose numerator ''m'' and denominator ''n'' do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit ''m''. This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern-Brocot tree, and [[continued fraction]]s.

== Scaled rounding ==
This type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified increment|Rounding to a specified increment]] but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result. Concretely, the intent is to limit the number of significant digits, rounding the value so that non-significant digits will be dropped. This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating-point values with limited precision (such as IEEE-754 ''float'' and ''double'' types), but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base.

For example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps (for example [[wave length]]s, whose base is not necessarily an integer measure), or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widths (but the most common use is with integer bases such as 10 or 2).{{Citation needed|reason=sounds like made up name. Rounding to a given number of significant places as described above is as much as I've come across. Note: this may be named differently with several synonyms, such as &quot;logarithmic scaled rounding&quot;, but the principles are effectively used in floating point notations, but not only : logarithmic scales are very common in engineering.|date=August 2010}}

This type of rounding is based on a [[logarithmic scale]] defined by a fixed non-zero real scaling factor ''s'' (in most frequent cases this factor is ''s''=1) and a fixed positive base ''b''&gt;1 (not necessarily an integer and most often different from the scaling factor), and a fixed integer number ''n''&gt;0 of significant digits in that base (which will determine the value of the increment to use for rounding, along with the computed effective scale of the rounded number).

The primary argument number (as well as the resulting rounded number) is first represented in [[exponential notation]] ''x'' = ''s''·''a''·''m''·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;, such that the sign ''s'' is either +1 or −1, the absolute [[mantissa]] ''a'' is restricted to the half-open positive interval [1/''b'',1), and the exponent ''c'' is any (positive or negative) integer. In that representation, all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero.

If the source number (or rounded number) is 0, the absolute mantisssa ''a'' is defined as 0, the exponent ''c'' is fixed to an arbitrary value (0 in most conventions, but some floating-point representations cannot use a null absolute mantissa but reserve a specific maximum negative value for the exponent ''c'' to represent the number 0 itself), and the sign ''s'' may be arbitrarily chosen between −1 or +1 (it is generally set to +1 for simple zero, or it is set to the same sign as the argument in the rounded value if the number representation allows to differentiate positive and negative zeroes, even if they finally represent the same numeric value 0).

A scaled exponential representation as ''x'' = ''a''·''s''·''b''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; may also be used equivalently, with a signed mantissa ''a'' either equal to zero or within one of the two half-open intervals (−1,−1/''b''] and [+1/''b'',+1), and this will be the case in the algorithm below.

The steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following:
# if ''x'' equals zero, simply return ''x''; otherwise:
# convert ''x'' into the scaled exponential representation, with a signed mantissa:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;x = a \cdot s \cdot b^c\,&lt;/math&gt;
## let ''x’'' be the unscaled value of ''x'', by dividing it by the scaling factor ''s'':&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;x' = x / s\,&lt;/math&gt;;
## let the scaling exponent ''c'' be one plus the base-''b'' logarithm of the absolute value of ''x’'', rounded down to an integer (towards minus infinity):&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;c = 1 + \left\lfloor \log_b \left| x' \right| \right\rfloor = 1 + \left\lfloor \log_b \left| x / s \right| \right\rfloor\,&lt;/math&gt;;
## let the signed mantissa ''a'' be product of ''x’'' divided by ''b'' to the power ''c'':&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;a = x' \cdot b^{-c} = x / s \cdot b^{-c}\,&lt;/math&gt;
# compute the rounded value in this representation:
## let ''c’'' be the initial scaling exponent ''c'' of ''x’'':&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;c' = c\,&lt;/math&gt;
## let ''m'' be the increment for rounding the mantissa ''a'' according to the number of significant digits to keep:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;m = b^{-n}\,&lt;/math&gt;
## let ''a’'' be the signed mantissa ''a'' rounded according to this increment ''m'' and the selected rounding mode:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;a' = \mathrm{round}(a, m) = \mathrm{round}(x / s \cdot b^{n-c'}) \cdot b^{-n}\,&lt;/math&gt;
## if the absolute value of ''a’'' is not lower than ''b'', then decrement ''n'' (multiply the increment ''m'' by ''b''), increment the scaling exponent ''c’'', divide the signed mantissa ''a'' by ''b'', and restart the rounding of the new signed mantissa ''a'' into ''a’'' with the same formula; this step may be avoided only if the abtract &quot;round()&quot; function is always rounding ''a'' towards 0 (i.e. when it is a simple truncation), but is necessary if it may be rounding ''a'' towards infinity, because the rounded mantissa may have a higher scaling exponent in this case, leaving an extra digit of precision.
# return the rounded value:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt;y = \mathrm{scaledround}(x, s, b, n) = a' \cdot s \cdot b^{c'} = \mathrm{round}(x / s \cdot b^{n-c'}) \cdot s \cdot b^{c'-n}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

For the abstract &quot;round()&quot; function, this type of rounding can use any one of the ''rounding to integer'' modes described more completely in the next section, but it is most frequently the ''round to nearest'' mode (with tie-breaking rules also described more completely below).

For example:
* the scaled rounding of 1.234 with scaling factor 1 in base 10 and 3 significant digits (maximum relative precision=1/1000), when using any ''round to nearest'' mode, will return 1.23;
* similar scaled rounding of 1.236 will return 1.24;
* similar scaled rounding of 21.236 will return 21.2;
* similar scaled rounding of 321.236 will return 321;
* the scaled rounding of 1.234 scaling factor 1 in base 10 and 3 significant digits (maximum relative precision=1/1000), when using the ''round down'' mode, will return 1.23;
* similar scaled rounding of 1.236 will also return 1.23;
* the scaled rounding of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 3\pi/7 \; \approx \; 6.8571 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; with scaling factor &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \pi&lt;/math&gt; in base 2 and 3 significant digits (maximum relative precision=1/8), when using the ''round down'' mode, will return &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 6 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-4} \; = \; 3\pi/8&lt;/math&gt;;
* similar scaled rounding of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 5\pi/7 \; \approx \; 5.7143 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; will return &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 5 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-3} \; = \; 5\pi/8&lt;/math&gt;;
* similar scaled rounding of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \pi/7 \; \approx \; 4.5714 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-5} &lt;/math&gt; will return &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 4 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-5} \; = \; \pi/8&lt;/math&gt;.
* similar scaled rounding of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \pi/8 \; = \; 4 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-5} &lt;/math&gt; will also return &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 4 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-5} \; = \; \pi/8&lt;/math&gt;.
* similar scaled rounding of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \pi/15 \; \approx \; 4.2667 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-6} &lt;/math&gt; will return &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 4 \cdot \pi \cdot 2^{-6} \; = \; \pi/16&lt;/math&gt;.

== Round to available value ==

Finished [[lumber]], writing paper, [[capacitor]]s, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then &quot;round&quot; to some standard size using phrases such as &quot;round down to nearest standard value&quot;, &quot;round up to nearest standard value&quot;, or &quot;round to nearest standard value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

When a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale,
Choosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding.
Such &quot;rounded&quot; values can be directly calculated.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Floating-point rounding==
In floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value ''x'' into a value ''z'' with a specified number of ''significant'' digits. In other words, ''z'' should be a multiple of a number ''m'' that depends on the magnitude of ''z''. The number ''m'' is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point form.

Apart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor ''s''=1, and an integer base ''b''&gt;1.

For results where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if ''x'' is negative), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to even'' is always the appropriate infinity.

In addition, if the rounded result would underflow, i.e. if the exponent would exceed the lowest representable integer value, the effective result may be either zero (possibly signed if the representation can maintain a distinction of signs for zeroes), or the smallest representable positive finite number (or the highest representable negative finite number if ''x'' is negative), possibly a ''denormal'' positive or negative number (if the mantissa is storing all its significant digits, in which case the most significant digit may still be stored in a lower position by setting the highest stored digits to zero, and this stored mantissa does not drop the most significant digit, something that is possible when base ''b''=2 because the most significant digit is always 1 in that base), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an underflow for the usual case of ''round to even'' is always the appropriate zero.

== Double rounding ==

Rounding a number twice in succession to different precisions, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.

Some computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations, the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a &quot;strictfp&quot; qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.

== Exact computation with rounded arithmetic ==
It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range. For example, if we know that an integer ''n'' is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting ''n'' to a floating-point value ''x'', computing the approximate square root ''y'' of ''x'' with floating point, and then rounding ''y'' to the nearest integer ''q''. If ''n'' is not too big, the floating-point roundoff error in ''y'' will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value ''q'' will be the exact square root of ''n''. In most modern computers, this method may be much faster than computing the square root of ''n'' by an all-integer algorithm.

== The table-maker's dilemma ==

William Kahan coined the term &quot;The Table-Maker's Dilemma&quot; for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:
:: &quot;Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute  y^w  correctly rounded for ''every'' two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary transcendental functions mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't Y^W be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it ''correctly'' to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kahan |first=William |title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. However, no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best.

Using the Gelfond–Schneider [[theorem]] and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic'', J.-M. Muller et al., Chapter 12 ''Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma'', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some packages around now that offer full accuracy. The [[MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103151|title=An accurate elementary mathematical library for the IEEE floating point standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to devise well-defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but unprovable, then it is impossible to correctly round down 0.5 + 10&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt; where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0.5 if there is no such number. This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.

==History==
The concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. &quot;YBC 7289 clay tablet&quot;. 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rounded approximations to [[Pi (mathematical constant)|π]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient.

The ''Round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 4th edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors'' &lt;ref&gt;
   http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=05170001&amp;view=50&amp;frames=0&amp;seq=48
&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Simpson Woodward called this &quot;the computer's rule&quot; indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. Churchill Eisenhart's 1947 paper &quot;Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data&quot; (in ''Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis'', McGrawHill, 1947, Eisenhart, Hastay, and Wallis, editors) indicated that the practice was already &quot;well established&quot; in data analysis.

The origin of the term &quot;bankers' rounding&quot; remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts'' &lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that &quot;half-way&quot; amounts should be rounded up.

Until the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case, specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.

==Rounding functions in programming languages ==
Most [[programming language]]s provide functions or special [[syntax]] to round [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C programming language|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable, or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.

In the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up/ceiling, down/floor, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE-754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[Double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary.  Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits, this approach may avoid spurious [[arithmetic overflow|overflows]] in languages have 32-bit integers. Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a &quot;printf&quot; or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision''). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.

On the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface-description-language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE-754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[Javascript]] or ECMAScript&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification]&lt;/ref&gt; interface bindings).

== Other rounding standards ==

Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.

=== U.S. Weather Observations ===

In a guideline issued in mid-1966,&lt;ref&gt;OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1], Washington, DC., 104 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest  round number, with the &quot;round half up&quot; tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was &quot;round half away from zero&quot;.

=== Negative zero in meteorology ===
Some [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write &quot;-0&quot; to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and -0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer. This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the [[Celsius]] scale, where below zero indicates freezing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In [[math]], there are many subjects. One of these is [[group theory]]. In group theory, the '''Monster group''' (shortened to ''M'' or ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is important. It is also called the Fischer-Griess Monster, or the Friendly Giant. It is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of finite [[order (group theory)|order]], which is equal to:

:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; · 3&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; · 5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; · 7&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; · 11&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; · 13&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; · 17 · 19 · 23 · 29 · 31 · 41 · 47 · 59 · 71 
: = 808017424794512875886459904961710757005754368000000000
: ≈ 8 · 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;.

It is a ''[[simple group]]''. Simple groups have only two [[normal subgroup]]s: the identity element, and ''M''.

The finite simple groups  have been completely classified (the [[classification of finite simple groups]]). There are two kinds of [[finite simple groups]] in the [[list of finite simple groups]]. The first kind has 18 [[countably]] infinite families. The second kind has 26 [[sporadic groups]]. They are not as systematic. The Monster group is the largest of these sporadic groups. It contains all but six of the other sporadic groups inside of it. [[Robert Griess]] has called these six exceptions [[pariah group|pariahs]]. The rest make up the '''happy family'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="975">The '''equivalence relation''' is a [[relation (mathematics)|mathematical relation]] that is [[symmetry|symmetric]], [[transitivity|transitive]] and [[reflexive]]. Using this relation, it is possible to partition a [[set]] into (non-empty) subsets, which are called ''equivalence classes''. As an example, look at the animals on a farm: We now define a relation: we say that two animals are related, if they belong to the same [[species]]. That way, a [[cow]] is related to an [[ox]], but not to a [[chicken]]. The relation we just defined is an equivalence relation:
*It is ''reflexive'': each animal is of the same species as itself
*It is ''symmetric'': if the cow is the same species than the ox, then the ox is also the same species as the cow.
*It is ''transitive'': if a cow and a bull, and a bull and an ox are of the same species, they are all of the same species of [[cattle]]
In this example, all cattle form an equivalence class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1459">A '''direct proof''' is a way of showing that something is true or false by using [[logic]]. This is done by combining known facts. No [[assumption]]s are made when doing a direct proof. [[Lemma (mathematics)|Lemmas]] and [[theorem]]s are used to prove direct proofs.

A statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form &quot;if ''p'', then ''q''.&quot; Here, ''p'' and ''q'' are facts. To solve a statement like this, every case where ''p'' is true must be considered.

For example, this statement can be solved with a direct proof: &quot;if x and y are [[even]] [[integer]]s, then x+y is an even integer.&quot; Since x and y are even, then we can say that ''x=2m'' and ''y=2n,'' where ''m'' and ''n'' are integers. (This is a lemma.) We can also say that ''m+n'' is an integer, because adding two integers gives an integer. (This is another lemma.) Then we can say that ''x+y=2m+2n=2(m+n)''. Since ''m+n'' is an integer, we can say ''2(m+n)=2k'', where ''k=m+n''. We know that any integer [[multiplication|times]] 2 is an even integer. We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer.

Direct proofs are used in [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]]. The opposite of a direct proof is an [[indirect proof]] (also called a ''proof by contradiction''.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1150">The '''surface area to volume ratio''' of an object is the relationship between two [[measurement]]s. It is the [[ratio]] of [[Surface area]] to [[volume]].  It shows the [[wikt:comparison|comparison]] between the size of the outside of an object and the amount it can hold inside it. Small objects have a large surface area compared to the volume. This gives them a large ratio of surface to volume. Larger objects have small surface area compared to the volume so they have a small surface area to volume ratio. Two common ways of writing it are '''sa/vol''' or '''SA:V'''.

==Example==
{| class=wikitable
|-
|[[Cube]] 1 measures 1 meter on each side. 
:It has a surface area of 6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.   [[Surface area]] = [[length]] x length or length&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) multiplied by the number of sides (6). 
:It has a volume of 1 cubic meter. [[Volume]] =  length x length x length or length&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
:: Its ratio is 6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per cubic meter.
|-
|Cube 2 had sides that measured 10m
:its surface area is 600&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
:Its volume is 1000 cubic meters
::Its ratio is 0.6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per cubic meter.

[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|250px|[[Graph (mathematics)|Graphs]] like this are among the objects studied by discrete mathematics, for their interesting [[graph property|mathematical properties]], their usefulness as models of real-world problems, and their importance in developing computer [[algorithm]]s.]]

'''Discrete mathematics''' is the study of [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[Mathematical structure|structures]] that are [[discrete space|discrete]] rather than [[Continuous function|continuous]].  In contrast to [[real number]]s that vary &quot;smoothly&quot;, discrete mathematics studies objects such as [[integer]]s,  [[Graph (mathematics)|graphs]], and statements in [[Mathematical logic|logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Johnsonbaugh, ''Discrete Mathematics'', Prentice Hall, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These objects do not vary smoothly, but have distinct, separated values.&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W., &quot;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiscreteMathematics.html Discrete mathematics]&quot; from MathWorld.&lt;/ref&gt; Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in &quot;continuous mathematics&quot; such as [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].  Discrete objects can often be [[enumeration|counted]] using integers. Mathematicians say that this is the branch of mathematics dealing with [[countable set]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman L. Biggs]], ''Discrete mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; (sets that have the same cardinality as subsets of the natural numbers, including rational numbers but not real numbers). However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of the term &quot;discrete mathematics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hopkins, ''Resources for Teaching Discrete Mathematics'', Mathematical Association of America, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Many times, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.

The set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term '''finite mathematics''' is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.

Research in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of [[digital computers]] which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, [[programming language]]s, [[cryptography]], [[automated theorem proving]], and [[software development]]. In turn, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in [[operations research]].

Although the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.

'''Dynamical systems theory''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]]. It tries to describe complex dynamical systems, often using [[differential equations]] and [[Recurrence relation|difference equations]]. When differential equations are used, the theory is called ''continuous'' dynamical systems theory. When difference equations are used, it is called ''discrete'' dynamical systems theory.

The theory looks at the long-term behaviour of dynamical systems. It also studies solutions to the [[equations of motion]], mainly for mechanical systems. The study also includes the motion of planets, or electronic circuits. Part of it focuses on solving [[Partial differential equation]]s that occur in biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">A '''mathematical model''' is a description of a [[system]] using [[mathematics|mathematical]] concepts and language. The process of building a mathematical model is termed '''mathematical modeling'''. Mathematical models are used in the [[natural sciences]] (such as [[physics]], [[biology]], [[earth science]], [[meteorology]]) and [[engineering]] disciplines (e.g. [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]]). They are also used in the [[social sciences]] (such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[political science]]). [[Physicist]]s, [[engineer]]s, [[statistician]]s, [[operations research]] analysts and [[economist]]s use mathematical models a lot.[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6550437&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6550437][http://www.thinkmind.org/index.php?view=article&amp;articleid=icn_2014_3_40_30195]

Mathematical models can take many forms.  The types of models include: 
*[[dynamical system]]s - for systems that change,
*[[statistical model]]s - for finding patterns in large groups of measurements or data, 
*[[differential equation]]s - to study how variables change over time, or 
*[[Game theory|game theoretic models]] - for studying how many independent decision makers can interact.
These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. Mathematical models can include [[logical model]]s.  In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models built on theory agree with results of repeatable experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6923810&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6923810 experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;  When theoretical mathematical models do not match experimental measurements, scientists try to correct the model.  Such corrections lead the way to better theories to explain the facts.

'''3D''' (or '''3-D''') means three-dimensional, or having three [[dimension]]s. For example, a box is three-dimensional; it is [[solid]], and not [[thin]] like a piece of [[paper]]. It has [[volume]], a top and bottom, left and right ([[side]]s), as well as a front and back. You can turn the box around to view it from another side (called a [[face]], [[surface]] or simply [[side]]).

A dimension is measurable in [[inch]]es, [[micron]]s, [[mile]]s, [[kilometer]]s, or any other unit of [[length]].

The three dimensions are often called [[length]] (or depth), [[width]] (or breadth), and [[height]]. Some purposes use other words. 

3D [[graphics]] are used to make [[video games]] or [[animation|animated movies]]. A lot of [[wikt:calculation|calculations]] are needed to make pictures seem three-dimensional on a screen. Modern computers usually have a GPU (graphics processing unit) to handle these calculations.

[[File:Coord_planes_color.svg|thumb|upright|left|Picture of the &quot;X [[axis (mathematics)|axis]]&quot;, &quot;Y [[axis (mathematics)|axis]]&quot;, and &quot;Z [[axis (mathematics)|axis]]&quot;.]]
[[File:3D-plot.png|thumb|upright|left|A 3D mathematical picture, or [[wikt:graph|graph]], with lines measuring width, height, and length.]]

== In mathematics ==

In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], length, width, and height are given letters ([[variable]]s) to make them easier to write, or if a [[value]] is not known. Often X is width, Y is height, and Z is length.  Another common 3D [[coordinate system]] uses [[spherical coordinates]].

The mathematical study of shapes and dimensions is called [[geometry]]. Geometry can be used to find things such as [[volume]], [[area]], and how tall a mountain is.

== Time ==

Some people see [[time]] as a fourth dimension. It is also measured. It is measured in units of time such as [[second]]s, [[hour]]s, [[year]]s, or any other measurement of [[time]].

'''Stability''' is a property of many [[system]]s. It means being at rest, not liable to change. In [[mechanics]] and [[fluid dynamics|dynamics]], a system is stable (has stability) if it will not change [[motion]] of its own accord, and will resist small efforts to change its direction or position.

Thus an [[airliner]] in flight is dynamically stable, and will keep going in the same direction even when buffeted by uneven air pressure ([[wind]]). To change its direction, its [[control system]] must be altered. On the other hand, a [[fighter plane]] is unstable, and must be controlled at all times by a combination of the [[pilot]] and a computer.

Most nuclear [[isotope]]s are unstable, but the world is mostly made of stable ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1609">A '''weighted average''' is the [[average]] of values which are scaled by importance.  The weighted average of values is the [[sum]] of weights [[multiplication|times]] values [[division (mathematics)|divided by]] the sum of the weights.

== Basic example ==

Given two school classes, one with 20 students, and one with 30 students, the grades in each class on a test were:

:Morning class = 62, 67, 71, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 89, 93, 98

:Afternoon class = 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 90, 90, 90, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

The straight average for the morning class is 80 and the straight average of the afternoon class is 90. The straight average of 80 and 90 is 85, the mean of the two class means. However, this does not account for the difference in number of students in each class, hence the value of 85 does not reflect the average student grade (independent of class). The average student grade can be obtained by averaging all the grades, without regard to classes (add all the grades up and divide by the total number of students):

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{x} = \frac{4300}{50} = 86.
&lt;/math&gt;

Or, this can be accomplished by weighting the class means by the number of students in each class (using a weighted mean of the class means):

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac{(20\times80) + (30\times90)}{20 + 30} = 86.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the weighted mean makes it possible to find the average student grade in the case where only the class means and the number of students in each class are available.

Approximations are used for the following reasons:
#There are no known ways to solve a problem using calculus. Examples for such problems are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] or the [[Three-body problem]]
#There is a way to solve a problem using calculus. Getting an exact solution is impractical though, because it requires a long time, or many resources. An example for this is calculating [[Power series]].

One of the earliest known uses of numerical analysis is a [[Babylonian]] [[clay]] [[tablet]], which approximates the [[square root]] of 2. In a [[unit square]], the diagonal has this length. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle is extremely important, for instance, in [[carpentry]] and [[construction]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Zealand Qualification authority specifically mentions this skill in document 13004 version 2, dated 17 October 2003 titled [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/13004.pdf CARPENTRY THEORY: Demonstrate knowledge of setting out a building]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.

Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary [[differential equation]]s appear in [[Proper motion|star movement]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] occurs in portfolio management; [[numerical linear algebra]] is important for data analysis; [[Probability theory|stochastic]] [[differential equation]]s and [[Markov chain]]s are essential in simulating living cells for [[medicine]] and [[biology]].

[[Computer]]s greatly helped this task. Before there were computers, numerical methods often depended on hand [[interpolation]] in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software [[algorithms]] for solving [[differential equations]].

'''4D (four dimensions)''' is an important idea in [[geometry]].

Three-dimension space ([[3D]]) has length, depth and height. The fourth dimension is in relation to that three dimensions like a vertical dimension.

In some branches of [[physics]] time is considered as a fourth dimension but in real time people are not allowed to perceive it and it is used for modeling physical and social causes.

In mathematics, four-dimension space is an abstract concept which has been studied by mathematics and philosophers for almost three hundred years.

Mathematicians who studied four-dimension space include [[Möbius]], Schläfi, Bernard Riemann, Charles Howard Hinton, etc.

In twentieth century the concept of [[spacetime]] was developed. It connects space and time. The difference is that spacetime is not a [[Euclid]]ean space but it is called &quot;Minkowski continuum&quot;. The four-dimension space was mostly studied in the nineteenth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3737">[[Image:Absolute value.svg|thumb|360px|The [[graph of a function|graph]] of the absolute value function for real numbers.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''absolute value''' of a [[real number]] is the number without the sign. The absolute value of ''2'' is ''2'', the absolute value of ''-2'' is also 2. This notation is to express a number's distance from zero on a number line. The absolute value of 10 would be 10 since the number 10 is 10 numbers away from zero, same follows with negatives.
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{cases}
\ \;\,\ \ x &amp;\mathrm{if}\ x \ge 0\\
\ \;\, - x &amp;\mathrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==
For any [[real number]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is denoted by {{math|{{!}} ''x'' {{!}}}} (a [[vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson, [http://books.google.com/books?id=A8hAm38zsCMC&amp;pg=PA2 p.&amp;nbsp;2].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|x| = \begin{cases} x, &amp; \mbox{if }  x \ge 0  \\ -x,  &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0 (number)|zero]], but never [[negative number|negative]].
From an [[analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[distance]] from zero along the [[real number line]]. The absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them.

In [[calculus]], the absolute value function is [[differentiable]] except at 0. It is everywhere [[continuous]].

Compare the [[norm]] of a [[vector]].

The [[square-root]] notation without sign represents the ''positive'' square root. So, it follows that

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; | &lt;math&gt;|a| = \sqrt{a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|1}})
|}

which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Stewart, James B. | coauthors= | title=Calculus: concepts and contexts | year=2001 | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Australia  | isbn=0-534-37718-1 | pages=}}, p.&amp;nbsp;A5&lt;/ref&gt;

The absolute value has the following four main properties:

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width: 250px&quot; |&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;width: 100px&quot; | ({{EquationRef|2}})
| Non-negativity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a| = 0 \iff a = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|3}})
|Positive-definiteness
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|ab| = |a||b|\,&lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|4}})
|[[Multiplicativeness]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a+b|  \le |a| + |b|  &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|5}})
|[[Subadditivity]]
|}

Other important properties of the absolute value include:

:{|
|-
| style=&quot;width:250px&quot; |&lt;math&gt;||a|| = |a|\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;width: 100px&quot; | ({{EquationRef|6}})
|[[Idempotence]] (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value)
|-
| style=&quot;width:250px&quot; |&lt;math&gt;|-a| = |a|\,&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;width: 100px&quot; | ({{EquationRef|7}})
|[[Symmetry]]
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b| = 0 \iff a = b &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|8}})
|[[Identity of indiscernibles]] (equivalent to positive-definiteness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a - b|  \le |a - c| +|c - b|  &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|9}})
|[[Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a/b| = |a| / |b| \mbox{ (if } b \ne 0) \,&lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|10}})
|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|a-b| \ge ||a| - |b|| &lt;/math&gt;
| ({{EquationRef|11}})
|(equivalent to subadditivity)
|}

Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \le b \iff -b \le a \le b &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|a| \ge b \iff a \le -b \mbox{ or } b \le a &lt;/math&gt;

These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|x-3| \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -9 \le x-3 \le 9 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\iff -6 \le x \le 12 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The list of problems turned out to be very influential. After Hilbert's death, another problem was found in his writings; this is sometimes known as [[Hilbert's 24th problem]] today. This problem is about finding criteria to show that a solution to a problem is the simplest possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/news/Thiele.pdf Hilbert’s twenty-fourth problem] Rüdiger Thiele, American Mathematical Monthly, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 23 problems, three were unresolved in 2012, three were too vague to be resolved, and six could be partially solved. Given the influence of the problems, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] formulated a similar list, called the [http://www.claymath.org/millennium/ Millennium Prize Problems] in  2000.

==Summary==
The formulation of certain problems is better than that of others. 
Of the cleanly-formulated Hilbert problems, problems 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, and 21 have a resolution that is accepted by consensus. On the other hand, problems 1, 2, 5, 9, 15, 18&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and 22 have solutions that have partial acceptance, but there exists some controversy as to whether it resolves the problem.

The solution for problem 18, the [[Kepler conjecture]], uses a [[computer-assisted proof]].  This is controversial, because a human reader is unable to verify the proof in reasonable time. 

That leaves 16, 8 (the [[Riemann hypothesis]]) and 12 unresolved. On this classification 4, 16, and 23 are too vague to ever be described as solved. The withdrawn 24 would also be in this class. 6 is considered as a problem in physics rather than in mathematics.

==Table of problems==

The '''Kepler conjecture''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[conjecture]], about [[Sphere packing]] in three-dimnsional [[eucliean geometry|Euclidean]] space. It is named after [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571-1630) who first had this idea. Kepler supposed that the ways to pack [[sphere]]s of equal size that result in the packing with the highest [[density]] are [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] or [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] packings. These packings have a density of slightly over 74 percent, this means that they fill about 74 percent of space available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">In [[calculus]], a branch of mathematics, the '''limit of a function''' is the behavior of a certain [[Function (mathematics)|function]] near a selected input value for that function. Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with [[derivative]]s,  [[integration]], and [[differential equation]]s.

== Definition of the limit ==

The formal definition of the limit is as follows:
:''If the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; approaches a number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches a number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c}f(x) = L, \, &lt;/math&gt;

The notation for the limit above is read as &quot;The limit of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.&quot; Imagine we have a function such as &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, because &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1/0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, on the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x&lt;/math&gt; would have a vertical asymptote at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;. In limit notation, this would be written as:

:''The limit of &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which is denoted by  &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0}1/x = \infty, \, &lt;/math&gt;

=== Right and left limits ===
For the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x&lt;/math&gt;, we can get as close to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-values as we want, so long as we ''don't'' make &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as close as we want to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but without reaching it. The '''Left limit''' is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the '''Right limit''' is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x&lt;/math&gt;, since the limit for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is 0, if &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.

'''Mathematical induction''' is a special way of proving a mathematical truth. It can be used to prove that something is true for all the [[natural numbers]] (all the positive whole numbers). The idea is that 
* Something is true for the first case
* That same thing is always true for the next case
then
* That same thing is true for every case

In the careful language of mathematics:
* State that the proof will be ''by induction over &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''. (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''induction variable''.)
* Show that the statement is true when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is 1.
* Assume that the statement is true for any natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. (This is called the ''induction step''.)
** Show then that the statement is true for the next number, &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;.

Because it's true for 1, then it is true for 1+1 (=2, by the induction step), then it is true for 2+1 (=3), then it is true for 3+1 (=4), and so on. 

An example of proof by induction:

Prove that for all natural numbers ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt;1+2+3+....+(n-1)+n=\tfrac12 n(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

Proof: 

First, the statement can be written: for all natural numbers ''n''

:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^n k=n(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

By induction on ''n'',

First, for ''n''=1:
:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^1 k=2(1)=1(1+1)&lt;/math&gt;,

so this is true.

Next, assume that for some ''n''=''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' the statement is true. That is,:

:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k = n_0(n_0+1)&lt;/math&gt;

Then for ''n''=''n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''+1:

:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^{{n_0}+1} k&lt;/math&gt;

can be rewritten 

:&lt;math&gt;2\left( \sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k+(n_0+1) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^{n_0} k = n_0(n_0+1),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{k=1}^{n_0+1} k = n_0(n_0+1)+2(n_0+1) =(n_0+1)(n_0+2)&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the proof is correct.

==Similar proofs==

Mathematical induction is often stated with the starting value 0 (rather than 1). In fact, it will work just as well with a variety of starting values. Here is an example when the starting value is 3. 
The sum of the interior angles of a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sided polygon is &lt;math&gt;(n-2)180&lt;/math&gt;degrees.

The initial starting value is 3, and the interior angles of a triangle is &lt;math&gt;(3-2)180&lt;/math&gt;degrees. 
Assume that the interior angles of a &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sided polygon is &lt;math&gt;(n-2)180&lt;/math&gt;degrees. Add on a triangle which makes the figure a &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;-sided polygon, and that increases the count of the angles by 180 degrees &lt;math&gt;(n-2)180+180=(n+1-2)180&lt;/math&gt;degrees. Proved.

There are a great many mathematical objects for which proofs by mathematical induction works. The technical term is a ''well-ordered set''.

==Inductive definition==

The same idea can work to ''define'', as well as prove.

Define &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th degree cousin:
*A &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;st degree cousin is the child of a parent's sibling
*A &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;st degree cousin is the child of a parent's &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th degree cousin.

There is a set of axioms for the arithmetic of the natural numbers which is based on mathematical induction. This is called &quot;Peano's Axioms&quot;. The undefined symbols are | and =.
The axioms are
*| is a natural number
* If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then &lt;math&gt;n|&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number
*If &lt;math&gt;n| = m|&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;n = m&lt;/math&gt;

One can then define the operations of addition and multiplication and so on by mathematical induction. For example:

*&lt;math&gt;m + | = m|&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;m + n| = (m + n)|&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="705">'''Pure mathematics''' is a field of [[mathematics]]. Other fields of mathematics are driven and motivated by applications, they can be used to solve ''real-world'' problems, for example in [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. In contrast, pure mathematics studies [[abstraction|abstract ideas]] or it tries to make [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] more beautiful or easier to understand. 
== Examples ==
* Generalizing [[theorem]]s: Finding a more general theorem can lead to a better understanding of mathematics.
* Generality can also shorten proofs: There no longer is a need to handle special cases. This makes proofs shorter, simpler, and easier to follow or explain.

The '''chain rule''' is a way of finding the derivative of a function. It is used where the function is in another function. This is called a composite function.  

If F(x) equals two functions that we can take a derivative of, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;

then the derivative, F prime, is
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

==Steps==
'''1.''' Find the derivative of the outside function (all of it at once).

'''2.''' Find the derivative of the inside function (the bit between the brackets).

'''3.''' Multiply the answer from the first step by the answer from the second step.

;Example;

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=(x^2+5)^3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=3(x^2+5)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=3(x^2+5)^2(2x)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x)=6x(x^2+5)^2&lt;/math&gt;


In this example, the cubed sign (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is the outside function and &lt;math&gt;x^2+5&lt;/math&gt; is the inside function. The derivative of the outside function would be &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;, where the inside function is plugged in for x. The derivative of the inside function would be 2x, which is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;3(x^2+5)^2&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;6x(x^2+5)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Riemann sphere''' is a [[mathematical model]] of the extended complex plane. The model is named after [[Bernhard Riemann]]. The extended complex plane is the [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] of the [[complex number]]s, plus a point at infinity. With this model, this point at infinity is &quot;close&quot; to very large numbers in the same way zero is &quot;close&quot; to very small ones. The extended complex numbers are useful for [[Complex analysis]]: It certain cases, the [[division by zero]] is &quot;well-behaved&quot;, in the sense that dividing by zero gives this point at infinity. With this model, it is possible to change certain functions, so that they become [[Continuous function|continuous]], which simplifies calculation.

In [[geometry]], the Riemann sphere is a simple example of a [[Riemann surface]]. It is also one of the simplest [[complex manifold]]s.

The '''Whitney embedding theorem''' is a [[theorem]] in [[differential topology]]. It is named after [[Hassler Whitney]], an American mathematician. It says that a [[manifold]] (or real-life [[Physical body|object]] in [[Space (physics)|space]]) can be shown on a flat thing like a piece of paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1886">In [[mathematics]], '''function composition''' is a way to make a new [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from two other functions.

If we let ''f'' be a function from ''X'' to ''Y'' and ''g'' be a function from ''Y'' to ''Z'' then we say that ''g'' '''composed''' with ''f'' is written as ''g ∘ f'' a function from ''X'' to ''Z'' (notice how it is usually written in the opposite way to how people would it expect it to be as we will explain below).

The value of ''f'' given the input ''x'' is written as ''f(x)''. The value of ''g ∘ f'' given the input ''x'' is written ''(g ∘ f)(x)'' and is defined as ''g(f(x))'' (which means our way of writing ''g'' composed with ''f'' makes sense).

Here is another example. Let ''f'' be a function which [[double]]s a [[number]] ([[Multiplication|multiplies]] it by 2) and let ''g'' be a function which [[Subtraction|subtracts]] 1 from a number.

These would be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = 2x &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = x - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

''g'' composed with ''f'' would be the function which doubles a number and ''then'' subtracts 1 from it:

:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = 2x - 1&lt;/math&gt;

''f'' composed with ''g'' would be the function which subtracts 1 from a number and ''then'' doubles it:

:&lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)(x) = 2(x-1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

Function composition can be proven to be [[Associativity|associative]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Composition_of_Mappings_is_Associative]&lt;/ref&gt; which means:

:&lt;math&gt;f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;

Function composition is in general not [[Commutativity|commutative]] however,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Composition_of_Mappings_Not_Commutative]&lt;/ref&gt; which means:

:&lt;math&gt;f \circ g \neq g \circ f&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen in the first example where ''(g ∘ f)(2) = 2*2 - 1 = 3'' and ''(f ∘ g)(2) = 2*(2-1) = 2''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2409">In an [[experiment]], the [[variable]]s used can be classed as either '''dependent''' or '''independent variables'''. The ''dependent'' variable is the possible outcome of the experiment; the [[wikt:effect|effect]]. It [[wikt:depend|depends]] on what happens to other variables in the experiment. The dependent variable is basically the part that you are changing. For example, if you want to know how much [[light]] a [[plant]] needs to grow, the amount of growth is the dependent. If you wanted to see if a plant would grow better in hot or cold areas your dependent variable would be the [[temperature]] of the area the plant is left in.

The ''independent'' variable is the variable that you have control over, what you can choose and manipulate. It is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable. In some cases, you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable. It may be something that is already there and is fixed, something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else, the dependent variable like color, kind, time. As an example, you are interested in how [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] affects [[heart rate]] in humans. Your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate. You can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate.

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, the dependent variable changes with the independent variable, hence the name (it depends on the independent variable).

In [[calculus]], a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] is a map whose action is specified on variables. Take ''x'' and ''y'' to be two variables. A function ''f'' may map ''x'' to some expression in ''x''. Assigning gives a relation between ''y'' and ''x''. If there is some relation specifying ''y'' in terms of ''x'', then y is known as a dependent variable (and ''x'' is an independent variable).

A dependent variable is also known as a &quot;response variable&quot;, &quot;regressand&quot;, &quot;measured variable&quot;, &quot;responding variable&quot;, &quot;explained variable&quot;, &quot;outcome variable&quot;, &quot;experimental variable&quot;, and &quot;output variable&quot;.
 
If the independent variable is referred to as an &quot;explanatory variable&quot; then the term &quot;response variable&quot; is preferred by some authors for the dependent variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7836">[[Image:Gamma plot.svg|thumb|right|325px|The gamma function along part of the real axis]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''gamma function''' (Γ(''z'')) is an [[wikt:extend|extension]] of the [[factorial]] function to positive real and complex numbers. The argument of the function is shifted down by one. This means that if n is a [[Sign_(mathematics)|positive]] [[integer]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The gamma function is defined for all [[complex numbers]]. But it is not defined for negative numbers and zero. For a complex number whose real part is positive, it is defined by:
:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty  t^{z-1} e^{-t}\,{\rm d}t.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[improper integral]] is convergent. [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] first used the [[notation]] Γ(''z''). If the real part of the complex number&amp;nbsp;''z'' is positive (Re(''z'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), then the [[integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty  t^{z} e^{-t}\,\frac{{\rm d}t}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

[[absolute convergence|converges absolutely]]. It is known as the '''[[Euler integral (disambiguation)|Euler integral]] of the second kind'''. If we use [[integration by parts]], we see that the [[functional equation]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z+1)=z \, \Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; holds true for the gamma function.

We see that &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(1) = \int_0^\infty  e^{-t}\,{\rm d} = 1.&lt;/math&gt; So, by the [[recursive]] relation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z+1)=z \, \Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(n) = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \dots (n-1) = (n-1)!\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all positive integers&amp;nbsp;''n''.

== Properties ==
===General===
[[reflection formula|Euler's reflection formula]] is an important functional equation for the gamma function. It says:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma(1-z) \; \Gamma(z) = {\pi \over \sin{(\pi z)}} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

This means

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma(\varepsilon - n) = (-1)^{n-1} \; {{\Gamma(-\varepsilon) \; \Gamma(1+\varepsilon)} \over {\Gamma(n+1-\varepsilon)}} ~,
&lt;/math&gt;

The gamma function also has a duplication formula:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma(z) \; \Gamma\left(z + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2^{1-2z} \; \sqrt{\pi} \; \Gamma(2z). \,
&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is a special case of the [[multiplication theorem]]

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}\Gamma\left(z + \frac{k}{m}\right) = (2 \pi)^{(m-1)/2} \; m^{1/2 - mz} \; \Gamma(mz)\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

A property of the function is that:

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline{\Gamma(z)} = \Gamma(\overline{z}). \,\!
&lt;/math&gt;

A famous value of the function at a [[non-integral]] point is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\sqrt{\pi}. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This is found if we set&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/2 in the reflection or duplication formulas. If we simply make the [[substitution]] ''u = √t'' in the integral definition of the gamma function, we get a [[Gaussian integral]]. In general, for non-negative integer values of&amp;nbsp;''n'' we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}+n\right) = {(2n)! \over 4^n n!} \sqrt{\pi} = \frac{(2n-1)!!}{2^n}\, \sqrt{\pi} = \sqrt{\pi} \cdot \left[ {n-\frac{1}{2}\choose n} n! \right] &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}-n\right) = {(-4)^n n! \over (2n)!} \sqrt{\pi} = \frac{(-2)^n}{(2n-1)!!}\, \sqrt{\pi} = \sqrt{\pi} / \left[ {-\frac{1}{2} \choose n} n! \right] &lt;/math&gt;

where&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!!&lt;/nowiki&gt; denotes the [[double factorial]] and, when ''n'' = 0, (-1)!! = 1. 

The [[derivative]]s of the gamma function are described in terms of the [[polygamma function]]. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma'(z)=\Gamma(z)\psi_0(z)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For positive integer&amp;nbsp;''m'' the derivative of gamma function can be calculated as follows (here&amp;nbsp;γ is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma'(m+1) = m!\cdot\left(  - \gamma + \sum_{k=1}^m\frac{1}{k} \right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''n''-th derivative of the gamma function is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{{\rm d}^n}{{\rm d}x^n}\,\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x-1} e^{-t} (\ln t)^{n} \,{\rm d}t.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This can be derived by differentiating the integral form of the gamma function with respect to&amp;nbsp;''x''. It is done by using [[differentiation under the integral sign]].&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Particular values ===
Some particular values of the gamma function are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lll}
\Gamma(-3/2) &amp;= \tfrac{4}{3} \sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx 2.363271801207 \\
\Gamma(-1/2) &amp;= -2\sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx -3.544907701811 \\
\Gamma(1/2) &amp;= \sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx 1.772453850905 \\
\Gamma(1) &amp;= 0! &amp;= 1 \\
\Gamma(3/2) &amp;= \tfrac{1}{2}\sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx 0.88622692545 \\
\Gamma(2) &amp;= 1! &amp;= 1 \\
\Gamma(5/2) &amp;= \tfrac{3}{4}\sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx 1.32934038818 \\
\Gamma(3) &amp;= 2! &amp;= 2 \\
\Gamma(7/2) &amp;= \tfrac{15}{8}\sqrt{\pi} &amp;\approx  3.32335097045\\
\Gamma(4) &amp;= 3! &amp;= 6 \\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Pi function===
[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] introduced the '''Pi function'''. This is another way of denoting the gamma function. In terms of the gamma function, the Pi function is

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(z) = \Gamma(z+1) = z \; \Gamma(z)  = \int_0^\infty  e^{-t} t^{z+1}\,\frac{{\rm d}t}{t},&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi(n) = n!\,,&lt;/math&gt;

for every non-negative integer ''n''.

==Applications==
===Analytic number theory===

The gamma function is used to study the [[Riemann zeta function]]. A property of the Riemann zeta function is its [[functional equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s)\pi^{-s/2} = \Gamma\left(\frac{1-s}{2}\right)\zeta(1-s)\pi^{-(1-s)/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Bernhard Riemann]] found a relation between these two functions. This was in 1859 paper &quot;Über die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Grösse&quot; (&quot;On the Number of Prime Numbers less than a Given Quantity&quot;)

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(z) \; \Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{z}}{e^t-1} \; \frac{dt}{t}.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''limit''' is the value that a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[sequence]] &quot;approaches&quot; or comes close to as the argument or index comes close to some value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician)|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]]|edition=6th|year=2008|isbn =0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limits are very important in [[calculus]] (and [[mathematical analysis]] in general). They are used to define [[continuous function|continuity]], [[derivative]]s, and [[integral]]s.

The concept of a limit of a [[sequence]] can be [[wikt:generalise|generalised]] to the idea of a limit of a [[net (topology)|topological net]]. It is closely related to [[limit (category theory)|limit]] and [[direct limit]] in [[category theory]].

In formulas, ''limit'' is usually abbreviated as '''lim''' as in lim(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''a''. If an [[mathematical expression|expression]] is approaching a limit, it is represented by the right arrow (→) as in ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''a''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''Idempotence''' is a property that an [[operation]] in [[mathematics]] or [[computer science]] may have. It roughly means that the operation can be carried out again and again without changing the result.

The word idempotence was made by [[Benjamin Pierce]] because he saw the concept when studying algebra.

The meaning is different if we are talking about different kinds of operations. It can also be used to describe [[elements]] than an operation can take:

* For a [[unary operation]] (or [[Function (mathematics)|function]]), that we label ''f'', we say that ''f'' is idempotent if for any ''x'' in the [[domain]] of ''f'' it is true that: ''f(f(x)) = f(x)''. For example, the [[absolute value]]: ''abs(abs(x)) = abs(x)''.

We say that an element ''c'' in the domain of ''f'' is an idempotent element if ''f(f(c)) = f(c)''. This means that ''f'' is idempotent if every element of its domain is an idempotent element.

* For a [[binary operation]], that we label ''*'', we say that ''*'' is idempotent if for any ''x'' which the binary operation can take the following is true: ''x * x = x''.

We say that an element ''c'' which ''*'' can take is an idempotent element for ''*'' if ''c * c = c''. For example, the number ''1'' is an idempotent element for [[multiplication]] because ''1'' times ''1'' is ''1''.

== Examples in the real world ==

If a call button inside an [[elevator]] is pressed then the elevator will go to the floor that is on the button. If it is pressed again then it will do the same thing. This means that the operation of pressing a button to make the elevator change floors is an idempotent operation.

If we mix two pots which have the same liquid in them into a new pot then we will have the same liquid in that pot. If we only care about ''what'' kind of liquid is in the pot (not how much) then mixing liquids is an idempotent binary operation.

The face of a clock looks the same if 12 hours have passed. So for the operation of &quot;letting time pass on a clock&quot; we see that letting 12 hours pass is an idempotent element (this is also true for all [[multiples]] of 12 like 24, 36, 48, ...).

In [[mathematics]], the '''maximum''' and '''minimum''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] are the largest and smallest [[value]] that the function takes at a given point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Larson | first1=Ron | authorlink=Ron Larson (mathematician)| last2=Edwards | first2=Bruce H. | title=Calculus | publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=9th | year=2009 | isbn=0-547-16702-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Thomas | first1 = George B. | last2=Weir | first2= Maurice D. | last3=Hass | first3=Joel |author3-link = Joel Hass| authorlink=George B.

Minimum means the least you can do of something. For example, if the minimum amount of [[dollar]]s you must pay for something is seven, then you can not pay six dollars or less (you must pay at least seven). You can do more than the minimum, but no less. Maximum means the most you can have of something. For example, if the maximum amount of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] you can juggle is five, you can not juggle more than five oranges. You can do the maximum or less.

For a [[differentiable]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;f(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is an extreme value for the set of all values &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[interior]] of the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]], by [[Fermat's theorem (stationary points)|Fermat's theorem]].

The example shows that several elements of the first set can be mapped to the same element of the second set. Both elements b and c of the first set map to element z of the second set.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''relation''' is used to describe certain properties of things. That way, certain things may be connected in some way; this is called a relation. It is clear, that things are either related, or they are not, there are no in-betweens. Relations are classified into four types based on mapping of elements. 

Formally, a relation is a set of n-tuples of equal degree. Thus a binary relation is a set of pairs, a ternary relation a set of triples, and so forth. In the language of set theory, a relation between two sets is a subset of their [[Cartesian product]]. 

The use of the term &quot;relation&quot; is often used as shorthand to refer to binary relations, where the set of all the starting points is called the ''domain'' and the set of the ending points is the ''range''. The domain is the x's, and the range is the y's.

==Different types of relations==
An example for such a relation might be a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. Functions associate keys with values. The set of all functions is a subset of the set of all relations - a function is a relation where the first value of every tuple is unique through the set.

Other well-known relations are the [[Equivalence relation]] and the [[Order theory|Order relation]]. That way, [[set]]s of things can be ordered: Take the first element of a set, it is either equal to the element looked for, or there is an order relation that can be used to classify it. That way, the whole set can be classified (compared to some arbitrarily chosen element).

Relations can be [[transitivity|transitive]]. One example of a transitive relation is &quot;smaller-than&quot;. If X &quot;is smaller than&quot; Y, and Y is &quot;smaller than&quot; Z, then X &quot;is smaller than&quot; Z

Relations can be [[symmetry|symmetric]]. One example of a symmetric relation is &quot;is equal to&quot;. If X &quot;is equal to&quot; Y, Y &quot;is equal to&quot; X.

Relations can be [[reflexive]]. One example of a reflexive relation is &quot;is equal to&quot;. X &quot;is equal to&quot; X.

Every subset of AxB is a relation from A to B.

[[Currying]] is a transformation that can be done to some relations: It is sometimes possible to change a relation that takes several arguments into a chain of relations that each only take one argument. Currying is often used in [[Lambda calculus]].

==Databases and relations==
Relationships are the established associations between two or more tables. Relationships are based on common fields from more than one table, often involving primary and foreign keys. See this article from MSDN: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb243835(v=office.12).aspx]

'''Map coloring''' is a term used for two different concepts: In [[geography]] and [[mapmaking]] it is used to say that colors are assigned to certain areas on a map. Examples of this are coloring that show the countries or divisions of a country, but also to visualize other data, for example the [[altitude]].  The other use is in [[mathematics]]: There it is used to describe the problem of finding the minimal number of colors needed to color a given map.

A '''cellular automaton''' is a [[Scientific modeling|model]] used in [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]]. The idea is to model a [[dynamic system]] by using a number of cells. Each cell has one of several possible states. With each &quot;turn&quot; or iteration the state of the current cell is determined by two things: its current state, and the states of the neighbouring cells. 

A very famous example of a cellular automata is [[Conway's Game of Life]]. [[Stanislaw Ulam]] and [[John von Neumann]] first described cellular automata in the 1940s. Conway's Game of Life was first shown in the 1970s. 

==Biology==
[[File:Textile cone.JPG|thumb|right|''Conus textile'' shows a cellular automaton pattern on its shell.]]
Some biological processes occur—or can be simulated—by cellular automata.

The patterns of certain [[seashell]]s  are generated by natural cellular automata. Examples can be seen in the [[genus (biology)|genera]] ''[[Cone snail|Conus]]'' and ''[[Cymbiola]]''. The [[pigment]] cells reside in a narrow band along the shell's lip. Each cell [[secretion|secretes]] pigments according to the activating and inhibiting activity of its neighbor pigment cells, obeying a natural version of a mathematical rule.&lt;ref name=coombs&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.maths.nott.ac.uk/personal/sc/Seashells09.pdf | author=Coombs, Stephen |title=The Geometry and Pigmentation of Seashells | pages=3–4 | date=February 15, 2009 | accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cell band leaves the colored pattern on the shell as it grows slowly. For example, the widespread species ''[[Conus textile]]'' bears a pattern resembling Wolfram's [[rule 30]] cellular automaton.&lt;ref name=coombs/&gt;

[[Plant]]s regulate their intake and loss of [[gas]]es via a cellular automaton mechanism. Each [[Stomata|stoma]] on the [[leaf]] acts as a cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0307811100 | last1 = Peak | first1 = West | last2 = Messinger | first2 = Mott | year = 2004 | title = Evidence for complex, collective dynamics and emergent, distributed computation in plants | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/4/918 | journal = Proceedings of the National Institute of Science of the USA | volume = 101 | issue = 4| pages = 918–922 |bibcode = 2004PNAS..101..918P | ref = harv | pmid=14732685 | pmc=327117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving wave patterns on the skin of [[cephalopod]]s can be simulated with a two-state, two-dimensional cellular automata, each state corresponding to either an expanded or retracted [[chromatophore]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gilly.stanford.edu/past_research_files/APackardneuralnet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Threshold automata have been invented to simulate [[neuron]]s, and complex behaviors such as recognition and learning can be simulated.&lt;ref name=ilachinski-275&gt;{{Harvnb|Ilachinsky|2001|p=275|ref=ilachinski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fibroblast]]s are similar to cellular automata, as each fibroblast only interacts with its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disordered Systems and Biological Organization|year=1986|pages=374–375|author=Yves Bouligand|authorlink=Fibroblasts, Morphogenesis and Cellular Automata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gauss-Bonnet theorem''' is a [[theorem]] that connects the [[geometry]] of a [[shape]] with its [[topology]]. It is named after the two [[mathematician]]s [[Carl Friedrich Gauß]] (1777-1855) and [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet]] (1812-1872) who both found it, independently of one another. The [[Curvature]] of the shape is used, as well as its [[Euler characteristic]].

      <comment>/* Negative exponents */ removed loose objects</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1431">An '''exponent''' tells you the  number of times the base appears as a factor.   [[exponentiation]].

For example:
The exponent in &lt;math&gt;2\cdot2\cdot2&lt;/math&gt; is 3. This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt;. This also may be known as two cubed. 
The exponent in &lt;math&gt;4\cdot4\cdot4\cdot4\cdot4&lt;/math&gt; is 5. This can also be written as &lt;math&gt;4^5&lt;/math&gt;.

Exponents are used in [[algebra]].

It is a number or symbol, placed above and to the right of the expression to which it applies, that indicates the number of times the expression is used as a factor. For example, the exponent 3 in &lt;math&gt;5^3&lt;/math&gt; indicates &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5&lt;/math&gt;; the exponent ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;(a + b)^x&lt;/math&gt; indicates &lt;math&gt;(a + b)&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by itself ''x'' times.

== Negative exponents ==
A '''negative exponent''' -1 is a way of saying  '[[fraction (mathematics)|divide]] 1 by this thing'. &lt;br&gt;
This is also known as a [[reciprocal]], so 
&lt;math&gt;x^{-1}=\frac{1}{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Negative exponents can also be different from -1.  In this case the negative exponent acts like a normal exponent, so
&lt;math&gt;x^{-2}=(x^{-1})^2=\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{x^{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;


The formula for a negative exponent in terms of a normal exponent is
&lt;math&gt;x^{-a}=\frac{1}{x^{a}}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we also have a multiplication, like in &lt;math&gt;2x^{-a}&lt;/math&gt;, it would be written as &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{x^{a}}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Ordering infinity */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5952">'''Infinity''' is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a [[Latin]] word, which means &quot;without end&quot;. Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop.

Infinity is not really an ordinary number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how ''many'' there is of something, instead of how ''big'' something is. For example, there are infinitely many [[whole number]]s (called [[integer]]s), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes.

There are two kinds of infinity: [[potential]] infinity and [[wikt:actual|actual]] infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is a more abstract idea. For example, there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down. 

== Infinity in Mathematics ==
[[Mathematicians]] have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity.&lt;ref name=ax&gt;To simply, we will assume several axioms like the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counting infinity===
The number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different cardinal numbers. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the [[natural numbers]]. There is a smallest infinite number, ''countable infinity''. It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the [[rational numbers]]. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero; &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. It is spoken &quot;aleph null&quot;. 
It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers.&lt;ref name=ax /&gt; The number of [[real numbers]], that is all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of [[rational numbers]], the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of mathematical [[functions]] is the next infinite cardinal number, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt;.
And these numbers go on without end. 

===Ordering infinity===
A different ''type'' of infinity are the [[ordinal numbers]], beginning &quot;first, second, third, ...&quot;. The order &quot;first, second, third, ...&quot; and so on to infinity is ''different'' from the order ''ending'' &quot;..., third, second, first&quot;. The difference is important for [[mathematical induction]]. The simple ''first, second, third, ... '' has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero: &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;. (Or simply omega &lt;math&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \omega&lt;/math&gt;.) The infinite series ending &quot;... third, second, first&quot; is &lt;math&gt; ^*\omega &lt;/math&gt;.

===The real line and complex plane===
The third ''type'' of infinity has the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This is treated as addition to the the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]]. It is the result of division by zero, or to indicate that a [[series]] is increasing (or decreasing) without bound. The series 1, 2, 3, ... increases without upper bound. This is written: the limit is &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;. In [[calculus]], the [[integral]] over all real numbers is written: &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

==The arithmetic of infinity==
Each kind of infinity has different rules.

===Addition, multiplication, exponentiation===

&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 + 1 = 1 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt; Addition with &quot;alephs&quot; is [[commutative]].  

&lt;math&gt; 2 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 \times 2 = \aleph_0 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; Multiplication with &quot;alephs&quot; is commutative.

&lt;math&gt; \aleph_0 + \aleph_1 = \aleph_1 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 2 ^ {\aleph_0} = \aleph_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=ax /&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; 1 + \omega = \omega \neq \omega +1 &lt;/math&gt;. Addition with &quot;omegas&quot; is not commutative.

&lt;math&gt; 2 \times \omega = \omega \neq \omega \times 2 &lt;/math&gt;. Multiplication with &quot;omegas&quot; is not commutative.

&lt;math&gt; \omega + \omega = \omega \times 2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x + \infty = \infty = \infty + \infty = \infty \times \infty = 2 ^ \infty &lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction, division===

&lt;math&gt; 1 / \infty = 0&lt;/math&gt; Otherwise, division by infinity is not meaningful. Subtraction with infinity is not meaningful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="798">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] the term '''Canonical form''', or sometimes '''Normal form''' refers to the usual representation of a mathematical object. For example, the canonical form of a [[positive integer]] in [[decimal representation]] is a [[finite set|finite]] [[sequence]] of [[digit]]s that does not begin with zero.

Mathematics has defined [[equivalence relation]]s for some objects. These equivalence realtions say that certain classes of objects are &quot;equal&quot;. These objects then belong to the same [[equivalence class]]. In such a case, a canonical form consists in the choice of a specific object in each class. For example, [[row echelon form]] and [[Jordan normal form]] are canonical forms for [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="628">In mathematics, two [[integer]]s (''a'' and ''b'') are '''coprime''' (or '''relatively prime''') if they share no common factors. In other words, there is no number, other than 1,  that divides both a and b.

As an example, 6 and 35 are coprime. 6 and 27 are not coprime, because 3 divides both 6 and 27.

==Properties of Coprime==

1. [[Prime number]]s are always '''coprime''' to each other.

2. Any two consecutive integers are always '''coprime'''.

3. Sum of any two '''coprime''' numbers is always '''coprime''' to their product.

4. 1 is trivially '''coprime''' with all numbers.

'''Probability''' is a part of [[mathematics]]. It has to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. 

For example, using probability, you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side. Often people call the side with the face &quot;heads&quot;, and the other side &quot;tails&quot;.

The probability (p) of an event is always between zero (impossible) and one (certain).

If we roll a [[dice|die]] ([[plural]]: [[dice]]), then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 (This is because there are 6 numbers on a die). Also, the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6. This is because it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 
The chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. Every time we roll the die, it will always land on a number between 1 and 6.

Probability can be figured out using [[mathematics]]. For example if you roll six dice, the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious, but can be figured out using math and science.

One of the most interesting things about chance is that to figure out the probability that two things will both happen you multiply their two probabilities together. For instance, suppose that you want to know the probability of rolling two dice and getting a certain combination (it could be two 6s or a 3 then a 5, just any two). The possibility of getting a 3 is one in six (⅙) and the possibility of getting a 5 is also one in six, so the chances of getting a 3 then a 5 is ⅙×⅙=⅟36. If that number is expressed as somewhere between 0 and 1, it equals 0.027...7, which is fairly low. The possibility of getting a 3, then a 5, and then a 2 would be ⅙×⅙×⅙=⅟216 or 0.00463, which is a much lower probability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1192">The '''Euler characteristic''' of a [[shape]] is a [[number]] that describes a [[topological space]], so that anything in the space will have the same number.
It is calculated by taking the number of [[Point (geometry)|points]] in the shape, the number of [[line]]s in the shape, and the number of [[wikt:face|faces]] of the shape. Then, you find the Euler characteristic with this formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\chi=V-E+F \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
V is the point count, E the line count, and F the amount of faces. For most common shapes, the Euler Characteristic is 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">'''Random''' is a term used in [[mathematics]] (and less formally) to mean that there is no way to reliably predict an outcome (to know what will happen ''before'' it happens) or sense a pattern. Something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any conscious reason, and therefore thought to be purely by chance. An example of a random event is winning a [[lottery]].

A [[computer]] can make lists of apparently random [[number]]s. Humans are unable to do this, because the [[brain]] works in [[pattern]]s. If someone is asked to keep saying &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; at random, an astute human observer or properly programmed computer might eventually be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns.

On a [[website]] such as English [[Wikipedia]] the user can click on &quot;Random page&quot; to get a random article. The chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page.

Sometimes the word &quot;random&quot; is used more loosely. There are websites of random [[joke]]s, which just means: a variety of jokes about all sorts of things.

In recent years young people have started to use the word &quot;random&quot; even more loosely to describe anything which is rather strange or has no [[logic]]. Sentences such as &quot;the mouldy cheese is escaping&quot; or &quot;I like pie and spam&quot; might be described as &quot;random&quot;, although this is not the proper [[dictionary]] or mathematical meaning of the word. 

== Making random numbers ==
[[File:Roulette wheel.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The ball in a [[roulette]] can be used as a source of randomness, because its behavior is very sensitive to the starting conditions.]]

There are several ways in which a process or system can be seen as ''random'':

# ''Randomness'' coming from the environment (for example, [[Brownian motion]], but also [[hardware random number generator]]s)
# ''Randomness'' coming from the starting conditions. This aspect is studied by [[chaos theory]]. It can be observed in systems that depend very much on differences in the conditions at the start. Examples of such systems are [[pachinko]] or [[dice]].
# ''Randomness'' generated by the system itself. This is also called [[pseudorandomness|pseudo-randomness]], and is the kind used in [[pseudo-random number generator]]s. There are many [[algorithm]]s (based on [[arithmetic]]s or [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]]) to generate pseudo-random numbers. The behavior of such a system can be predicted, if the [[random seed]] and the algorithm are known. These methods are quicker than getting &quot;true&quot; ''randomness'' from the environment.

The many [[applications of randomness]] have led to many different methods for generating random data. These methods may vary as to how unpredictable or [[statistical randomness|statistically random]] they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers.

Before there were computational [[random number generator]]s, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work. Results would sometimes be collected and distributed as [[random number table]]s.

Computers can make what appear to be random numbers. There are two ways to make them.
* There are different [[algorithm]]s to make random numbers. This makes it possible to model certain aspects of randomness, for example the [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of the generated numbers. Numbers generated in such a fashion will however always follow a pattern. Given one, or a few of them, a computer can calculate the next random number. Therefore, such numbers are called ''pseudorandom''.
* True random numbers are generated by observing a non-deterministic experiment. The number is then calculated based on the result of the experiment. An example might be to hook up a [[Geiger counter]] to a computer, to generate the number.

== In cryptography ==
[[Key (cryptography)|Keys]] for [[encryption]] must be random in order to be secure. Keys generated by a faulty random number generator have been cracked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">A '''ratio''' between two or more [[quantity|quantities]] is a way of measuring their sizes compared to each other. 

For example, if a school has 20 teachers and 500 pupils then the ratio of teachers to students is written as 20:500 (read as &quot;20 to 500&quot;). For another example, if a cake mix asks for 100 [[gram]]s of flour, 300 grams of butter and 25 grams of sugar then the ratio of flour to butter to sugar is written as 100:300:25 (read as &quot;100 to 300 to 25&quot;). 

Ratios can be simplified. In the school example, there were 20 teachers to 500 pupils. If we divided the children up into equally sized classes then each teacher's class would have 25 pupils. That means that for each teacher there are 25 pupils, i.e. the teacher to pupil ratio is 1:25. Another way to go from the ratio 20:500 to the ratio 1:25 is to simply divide both numbers in 20:500 by 20. '''Note''': The ratio 20:500 is the same as 1:25. They are just two ways of writing the same thing. Just like there are different ways of writing a fraction (for example {{nowrap|1=2/1 = 10/5}}), there are many ways of writing a ratio.

A, B and C are the angles. {{math|a}} is the side opposite {{math|A}}. {{math|b}} is the side opposite {{math|B}}. {{math|c}} is the side opposite {{math|C}}]]
The '''sine rule''' or '''law of sines''', is a [[theorem]] in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name=mathworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawofSines.html|website=mathworld|title=Law of Sines}}&lt;/ref&gt; It says that, if you have a triangle like the one in the picture, the [[equation]] below is true.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{\sin A} \,=\, \frac{b}{\sin B} \,=\, \frac{c}{\sin C} \,=\, D \!&lt;/math&gt;

This is another version, which is also true.
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\sin A}{a} \,=\, \frac{\sin B}{b} \,=\, \frac{\sin C}{c} \!&lt;/math&gt;

'''D''' is equal to the diameter of the triangle's [[circumcircle]]. 

The law of sines is used to find the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known. This is known as [[triangulation]]. However, this calculation can have a [[numerical error]] if an angle is close to 90 degrees. The law of sines can also be used when two sides and one of the angles not enclosed by the two sides are known. In some such cases, the formula gives two possible values for the enclosed angle. This is called an ''ambiguous case''.

The law of sines is one of two trigonometric equations which is used to find lengths and angles in scalene triangles. The other is the [[law of cosines]].

==Proof==
The area &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height (drawn from the vertex not on the base).  Depending on which side one chooses to be the base, the area can be given by
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2}b(c \sin A) = \frac{1}{2}c(a \sin B) = \frac{1}{2}a(b \sin C)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying these by &lt;math&gt;2/abc&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2T}{abc} = \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b} = \frac{\sin C}{c}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Navier–Stokes equations''' are mathematical [[equation]]s that describe the motion of [[fluid]]s. The equations are named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes]]. The equations result from applying [[Newton's second law]] to [[fluid]] motion, with the belief that the fluid [[stress (physics)|stress]] is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (in relation to the [[gradient]] of [[velocity]]), plus a [[pressure]] term.

They are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the [[weather]], [[ocean current]]s, water flow in a pipe, the air's flow around a [[airfoil|wing]], and motion of [[star]]s inside a [[galaxy]]. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Together with [[Maxwell's equations]] they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three [[dimension]]s solutions always exist ([[Existence theorem|existence]]), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any [[singularity]] (or [[infinity]] or {{broken wikt link|discontinuity|discontinuity}}) (smoothness). These are called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]], and offered a US$1,000,000 prize (approx. €0.7M or £0.6M as of September 2009) for a solution or a counter-example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The Navier–Stokes equations [[wikt:dictate|dictate]] not [[position]] but rather [[velocity]]. A solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a {{broken wikt link|Particle|particle}} or {{broken wikt link|deflect|deflection}} of a [[continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]].

In mathematics, the mediant of two [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{c} \text{ and } \frac{b}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

is 

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{c+d} &lt;/math&gt;.

It is commonly referred to as the '''freshman sum''', due to it being a common mistake when people learn about the addition of fractions. The operation is between two fractions, therefore the way these fractions are represented influence the mediant. For example, the mediant of 1/1 and 1/2 is 2/3, but the mediant of 2/2 and 1/2 is 3/4, even though the sum of both is 3/2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2382">The '''order of operations''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[Algebra|algebraic]] set of rules. It is used to evaluate (solve) and [[simplify]] [[equation|expressions and equations]]. The order of operations is the order that different mathematical operations are done. The standard mathematical operations are [[addition]] ('''+'''), [[subtraction]] ('''−'''), [[multiplication]] ('''*''' or '''×'''), [[Division (mathematics)|division]] ('''/'''), brackets (which are grouping symbols, like parentheses '''()''' or '''[]''') and [[exponentiation]] ('''^n''' or '''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''', also called orders or indices).

Mathematicians have agreed on a correct order to use operations, and it is very important that they know these rules. When people are solving a problem with more than one operation, they will need to know the correct order to solve the problem correctly. Otherwise the answer will be wrong.

== Rules ==

Follow all the rules in this order '''from left to right''' in the equation.	

=== Brackets and indices ===

Use operations inside brackets and solve any indices. You should always solve brackets first when solving an equation.

'''Example''':
:(2 + 3) * (4 -1) + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:'''(2 + 3)''' * (4 -1) + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:5 * (4 -1) + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:5 * '''(4 -1)''' + 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:5 * 3 + '''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
:5 * 3 + 8

=== Multiplication and division ===

Solve any multiplication and division in the problem.
Note that multiplication does not precede division; this is a common mistake. Both are solved from left to right as they occur.

'''Example''':
:5 * 4 - 9 / 3
:'''5 * 4''' - 9 / 3
:20 - 9 / 3
:20 - '''9 / 3'''
:20 - 3

=== Addition and subtraction ===

Lastly, solve any addition or subtraction.

=== Two examples of all rules ===
==== Example one ====
:(1 + 8) * (4 - 1) + 16 / 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:'''(1 + 8)''' * (4 - 1) + 16 / 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:9 * '''(4 - 1)''' + 16 / 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:9 * 3 + 16 / '''2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
:9 * 3 + 16 / 8
:'''9 * 3''' + 16 / 8
:27 + '''16 / 8'''
:27 + 2
:29

==== Example two ====
:(7 + 3) * (6 - 3) + 216 / 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:'''(7 + 3)''' * (6 - 3) + 216 / 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:10 * '''(6 - 3)''' + 216 / 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:10 * 3 + 216 / '''3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
:10 * 3 + 216 / 27
:'''10 * 3''' + 216 / 27
:30 + '''216 / 27'''
:30 + 8
:38

In [[mathematics]], '''algebraic varieties''' (also called '''varieties''') are one of the central objects of study in [[algebraic geometry]]. The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the [[set]] of solutions of a [[system of polynomial equations]], over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartshorne&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 58 --&gt;

Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ: Some authors require that an &quot;''algebraic variety''&quot; is, by definition, ''irreducible'' (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the [[Zariski topology]]), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called '''algebraic sets'''.

The notion of variety is similar to that of [[manifold]]. The difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singular points]], while a manifold will not. 
Proven around the year 1800, the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] establishes a link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] by showing that a [[monic polynomial]] in one variable with [[complex numbers|complex]] coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its [[root of a function|root]]s (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]] provides a fundamental correspondence between [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of [[polynomial ring]]s and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of [[ring theory]]. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of [[geometry]].

'''Algebraic geometry''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] studying zeros of [[polynomial equations]]. Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of [[abstract algebra]], especially [[commutative algebra]], with the language and the problems of [[geometry]].

The main objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s, and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics. The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as [[complex analysis]], [[topology]] and [[number theory]]. At the start, algebraic geometry was about studying [[systems of polynomial equations]] in several variables. Algebraic geometry starts at the point where [[equation solving]] leaves off: In many cases, finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution: this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
&lt;!-- this paragraph is misplaced in the lead. May be in the history section?

[[Descartes]]'s idea of [[coordinates]] is central to algebraic geometry, because a '''point''' of an algebraic variety is a point whose coordinates are a solution of the equations defining the variety. However it has undergone a series of remarkable transformations beginning in the early 19th century. Before then, the coordinates were assumed to be [[tuple]]s of [[real number]]s, but this changed when first [[complex number]]s, and then elements of an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]] became acceptable. [[Homogeneous coordinates]] of [[projective geometry]] offered an extension of the notion of coordinate system in a different direction, and enriched the scope of algebraic geometry. --&gt;

In the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.
* The main stream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]].
* The study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in the field of the [[rational number]]s or in a [[number field]] became [[arithmetic geometry]] (or more classically Diophantine geometry), a subfield of [[algebraic number theory]].
* The study of the real points of an algebraic variety is the subject of [[real algebraic geometry]].
* A large part of [[singularity theory]] is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.
* When computers became more common, a field named 'computational algebraic geomery' developed. It looks at  intersection of algebraic geometry and [[computer algebra]]. It is concerned with the development of [[algorithms]] and [[software]] for studying and finding the properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.

Much of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on &quot;intrinsic&quot; properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space. The developments in [[topology]], [[differential geometry|differential]] and [[complex geometry]] occurred much in the same way. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is [[Grothendieck]]'s [[scheme theory]] which allows one to use [[sheaf theory]] to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of [[differential manifold|differential]] and [[complex manifold|analytic manifolds]]. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], with a [[maximal ideal]] of the [[coordinate ring]], while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety.  This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles's proof]] of the longstanding conjecture called [[Fermat's last theorem]] is an example of the power of this approach.

'''Probability space''' is a [[mathematical model]] used to describe [[scientific]] [[experiments]] A probablity space consists of three parts:
# A [[sample space]] which lists all possible outcomes
# A [[set]] of events. Each event associates zero or more outcomes
# A [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that assigns probabilities to each event

An ''outcome'' is the result of a single execution of the model. Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex ''events'' are used to characterize groups of outcomes. The collection of all such events is a ''[[σ-algebra]]'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the ''[[probability measure]]'' function, ''P''.

Once the probability space is established, it is assumed that “nature” makes its move and selects a single outcome, ''ω'', from the sample space Ω. All the events in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; that contain the selected outcome ''ω'' (recall that each event is a subset of Ω) are said to “have occurred”. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function ''P''.

The prominent Soviet mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] introduced the notion of probability space, together with other [[axioms of probability]], in the 1930s.

In [[mathematics]], a [[sequence]] is an ordered list of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Weisstein, Eric W.|title=Sequence|publisher=MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource|url= http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sequence.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event consists of a mathematical object, which is a [[number]] in many cases. In some cases, the sequence tends towards a '''limit'''. In this case, the sequence is said to be '''convergent''', otherwise it is '''divergent'''.&lt;ref&gt;Courant, Richard (1961). ''Differential and Integral Calculus'' Volume I. Glasgow: Blackie &amp; Son, Ltd., p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a convergent sequence, the [[Absolute value|absolute]] difference between the value of the current element and the limit, &lt;math&gt;|x_{n} - lim(X)| &lt;/math&gt; will decrease as the sequence progresses. 

==Formal Definition==

We call &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; the '''limit''' of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; if the following condition holds:
:*For each [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that, for every natural number &lt;math&gt;n &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 
In other words, for every measure of closeness &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence's terms are eventually that close to the limit.  The sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''converge to''' or '''tend to''' the limit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;x_n \to x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x&lt;/math&gt;.

If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''; otherwise it is '''divergent'''.

==History==
The Greek philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] is famous for formulating [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes that involve limiting processes]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Edward (1998) ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Genealogy to Iqbal''. London: Routledge, p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leucippus]], [[Democritus]], [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archimedes]] developed the [[method of exhaustion]], which uses an infinite sequence of approximations to determine an area or a volume. Archimedes succeeded in summing what is now called a [[geometric series]].

[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] dealt with series in his works on ''Analysis with infinite series'' (written in 1669, circulated in manuscript, published in 1711), ''Method of fluxions and infinite series'' (written in 1671, published in English translation in 1736, Latin original published much later) and ''Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum'' (written in 1693, published in 1704 as an Appendix to his ''Optiks''). In the latter work, Newton considers the binomial expansion of (''x''+''o'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which he then linearizes by ''taking limits'' (letting ''o''→0).

In the 18th century, [[mathematician]]s like [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] succeeded in summing some ''divergent'' series by stopping at the right moment; they did not much care whether a limit existed, as long as it could be calculated. At the end of the century, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in his ''Théorie des fonctions analytiques'' (1797) opined that the lack of rigour precluded further development in calculus. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in his etude of [[hypergeometric series]] (1813) for the first time rigorously investigated under which conditions a series converged to a limit.

The modern definition of a limit (for any ε there exists an index ''N'' so that ...) was given by [[Bernhard Bolzano]] (''Der binomische Lehrsatz'', Prague 1816, little noticed at the time) and by [[Karl Weierstraß]] in the 1870s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1822">A '''postulate''' (also sometimes called an [[axiom]]) is a [[statement]] that is agreed by everyone to be correct. This is useful for creating [[wikt:proof|proof]]s in [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and postulates are often the basic 
[[truth]] of a much larger [[theory]] or [[law]].

Postulates themselves cannot be proven, but since they are usually obviously correct this is not a problem. Here is a good example of a postulate (given by [[Euclid]] in his studies about [[geometry]]).

:''Two points determine (make) a line.''
Using this postulate and four others like it, Euclid brought a new understanding of [[geometry]] to the world, and many people think they are some of the most [[influence|influential]] works in geometry even now.

Sometimes postulates are not obviously correct, but are required for their consequences. The easiest case must be with Albert Einstein's postulate that the universe is homogenous. This type of postulate was necessary to make possible some major scientific achievements, but can also be problematic since not self-evident. 

There are also a few [[wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s that all postulates should have.
# They should be obvious and easy to understand, and should not have too many words that are difficult to explain.
# There should not be very many of them.
# They should all work together without making any strange results (they should be [[consistency|consistent]]).
# They should also be true when they are alone (so they can be used [[independent]]ly).

Postulates are sometimes proved to be wrong after they have been known for a long time, but this is usually because something new has been [[Discovery (observation)|discovered]], and the original creator could not have known any better.

The '''least common multiple''' of two [[integer]]s is the smallest positive integer between all the [[multiple]]s of both. It is usually denoted by '''LCM(''a'', ''b'')'''. Likewise, the LCM of more than two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.

The LCM is known in elementary arithmetic as the &quot;least common denominator&quot; ([[lowest common denominator|LCD]]) that must be calculated before [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] can be added, subtracted or compared.

== Overview ==

A [[multiple]] of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 × 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of −5 and 2 as well.

== Relation with the greatest common divisor   ==

It is known that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{GCD}(a,b) \cdot \operatorname{LCM}(a,b) = |a \cdot b|&lt;/math&gt;

This formula is often used to compute the LCD, once known the GCD of ''a'' and ''b''.

The term is also used informally. 
:&quot;In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilized men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Boole]]. 1854/2003.

The '''Lorenz attractor''' (also called '''Lorenz system''') is a [[system of equations.]] [[Edward N. Lorenz]] formulated the [[equation|equations]] as a simplified [[mathematical model]] for [[atmospheric convection]]. The equations are [[ordinary differential equation]]s, called '''Lorenz equations'''.  They are notable for having [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] solutions for certain parameter values and starting conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system which, when plotted, resemble a butterfly or figure eight.

The notion of [[butterfly effect]] is coupled with that of the Lorenz attractor. Lorenz first used the phrase in a speech he gave in 1972.

'''Mathematics''', sometimes shortened to '''maths''' (in England, Australia, New Zealand and France) or '''math''' (in the United States, Canada and Germany) is the study of [[number]]s, [[shape]]s and [[pattern]]s. [[Mathematician]]s are people who learn about and discover such things in mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving [[problem]]s that occur in the real world, so many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics. Today, mathematics is needed in many jobs. [[Business]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[construction]] need some knowledge of mathematics.

Mathematicians [[wikt:solve|solve]] [[problem]]s by using [[logic]]. Mathematicians often use [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. [[Deduction]] is a special way of [[wikt:think|thinking]] to [[wikt:discover|discover]] and prove new [[wikt:truth|truths]] using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking.

== About ==
''Mathematics'' includes the [[study]] of:
* Numbers (example 3+6=9)
* [[Structure]]: how things are [[organisation|organized]].
* [[wikt:place|Place]]: where things are and their arrangement.
* [[wikt:change|Change]]: how things become different over time.

Mathematics uses [[logic]], paper, and calculator. These things are used to create general [[rule]]s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out [[information]] that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics [[solution|solves]] many [[problem]]s at the same time. 

A ''proof'' gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called ''axioms''. A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a ''theorem''. Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it. That idea is called a ''conjecture'' until they find a proof.

Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are [[choice|chosen]] because they are considered simple or [[Beauty|beautiful]]. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us [[knowledge|understand]] the world better.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1725">'''Closure''' describes the case when the results of a mathematical operation are always defined. For example, in ordinary arithmetic, addition has closure. Whenever one adds two numbers, the answer is a number. The same is true of multiplication. Division does '''not''' have closure, because division by 0 is not defined. In the [[natural numbers]], subtraction does not have closure, but in the [[integers]] subtraction does have closure. Subtraction of two numbers can produce a negative number, which is not a natural number, but it is an integer.

One can sometimes make closure of a mathematical object by including new elements. The integers are a closure of the natural numbers by including negative numbers. The [[real numbers]] are a closure of the [[rational numbers]] by including square roots of positive numbers. The [[complex numbers]] are a closure of the real numbers by including square roots of negative numbers.

Sometimes, if one includes an element to make closure, it makes more changes. For example, if one includes [[infinity]], &lt;math&gt;\infty = 1 / 0 &lt;/math&gt;, that is closure of division, the laws of addition and subtraction are changed. There is no inversion of addition for &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Ordinary closure is called finite closure. There is also infinite closure. The definition of a [[topological space]] mentions infinite closure. Open spaces have (finite) closure of [[intersection]]. Open sets have infinite closure of [[union (set theory)|union]]. That is, in mathematical notation, if A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ... A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ... are open sets, then B and C are open sets:

* &lt;math&gt;B = A_0 \cap A_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;C = {\cup_n} A_n &lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, '''combination''' is used for picking a number of objects from a given set of objects. [[Combinatorics]] looks at the number of possibilities to pick k objects from a set of n. It does not take into account the order, in which these are picked. People talk about finding [[permutation]]s, if the order in which the objects are picked matters.  It is easy to see that there are more permutations than combinations.  One combination, picking the objects 1,3, and 5 in the example can be done in the following ways:  {1,3,5}, {1,5,3}, {3,1,5},{3,5,1}, {5,3,1}, {5,1,3} and {5,3,1}.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Strahler number''' or '''Horton–Strahler''' number of any [[tree]] [[shape]] [[measure]]s its [[complexity]].&lt;ref&gt;''Artificial Intelligence Research and Development'', eds. Cecilio Angulo; Lluís Godo (Amsterdam; Washington, DC: IOS Press, 2007.), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to any tree shape including real trees, [[lung]]s, [[human]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[blood]] flow systems. These numbers allow these shapes to be handled in [[Programming language|computer programming languages]]. These [[number]]s were created to study the flow of [[liquid]]s by [[Robert E. Horton]] and [[Arthur Newell Strahler]].

Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[ML]] and [[Haskell]] say that functions can only have one argument.

In [[computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]], a '''decision problem''' is a question in some [[formal system]] with a yes-or-no answer. The answer is dependent on the values of the input parameters. Decision problems typically appear in mathematical questions of [[Decidability theory|decidability]], that is, the question of the existence of an [[effective method]] to determine the existence of some object or its membership in a [[set]]. Some of the most important problems in mathematics are [[undecidable]].
